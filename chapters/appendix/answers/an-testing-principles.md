## Principles of software testing

**Exercise 1**

1. Failure, the user notices the system/program behaving incorrectly.
2. Fault, this is a problem in the code, that is causing a failure in this case.
3. Error, the human mistake that created the fault.

**Exercise 2**

The absence-or-error fallacy.
While the software does not have a lot of bugs, it is not giving the user what they want.
In this case the verification was good, but they need work on the validation.

**Exercise 3**

Exhaustive testing is impossible.

**Exercise 4**

Test early, although an important principle, is definitely not related to the problem of only doing unit tests. All others help people in understanding that variation, different types of testing, is important.
