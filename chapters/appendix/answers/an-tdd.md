**Exercise 2**

How did it feel to practice TDD?


**Exercise 3**

Option 1 is the least important one.

Although a few studies show that the number of tests written by TDD practitioners are often higher than the number of tests written by developers not practicing TDD, this is definitely not the main reason why developers have been using TDD. In fact, among the alternatives, it's the least important one. All other alternatives are more important reasons, according to the TDD literature (e.g., Kent Beck's book, Freeman's and Pryce's book.


**Exercise 4**

Option 1 is not a benefit of TDD. The
TDD literature says nothing about team integration.
