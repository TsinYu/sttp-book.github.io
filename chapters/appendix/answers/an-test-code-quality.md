## Test code quality

**Exercise 1**

Correct: Both tests are very slow.


**Exercise 2**

Correct answer: Mystery guest


**Exercise 3**


Correct answer: It is hard to tell which of several assertions within the same test method will cause a test failure.


**Exercise 4**


Flaky test.

**Exercise 5**

To avoid the flakiness, a developer could have mocked the random function. It does not make sense, the test is about testing the generator and its homogeinity; if we mock, the test looses its purposes.
