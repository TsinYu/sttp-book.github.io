In this book, we are going to teach you how to effectively test a \nsoftware and make sure it works, and how to, as much as possible, \nautomate every step that we can. \nBy testing software, we mean that we are gonna explore different techniques to design test cases. For example, based on the requirements, based on the source code, analyze boundaries, and etc. And by automation, we mean making sure that a machine can do the tasks that humans would just take too much time to do, or would not be as good as a machine.\nYou are gonna see throughout the course that software testing is a very creative activity, and while creativity's fundamental, we are going to study systematic and rigorous ways to derive test cases. In addition, this course will be very practical. Meaning, whenever we discuss some technique, we are going to apply this technique in several examples.\n You should expect to see a lot of Java code throughout this course. And we hope that you can then generalize everything you learn here to test the software that you work in your real life. \nAnd so why should we think about software testing? Why should we actually care about software testing? \nBecause bugs are everywhere. And you, as a human being, probably faced a few bugs in your life. Some of them probably did not affect you that much, but definitely some other bugs really affected your life.\nSo just to give an impression of how easy doing mistakes is, let's start with a requirement.\nLet's suppose we have this customer and this person wants a software that given a list of numbers, should return the smallest and the largest number in this list. \nThis looks like a very simple program to do. Let's get our hands dirty and implement it in Java:\npublic class NumFinder {\n  private int smallest = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n  private int largest = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n\n  public void find(int[] nums) {\n    for(int n : nums) {\n      if(n  largest) largest = n;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // getters for smallest and largest\n}\n\nThe idea behind the code is as follows: we go through all the elements of this list and store the smallest number in a variable and the largest number in another variable.\nIf n is smaller than the smallest number we have seen, we replace it. \nWe do the same for the largest: if n is bigger than largest, we just replace largest to n. \nAnd, as developers, that is what we often do: we implement the requirements, and then do small checks to make sure it works.\nOne way to do a small check would be to come up with a main method that tries the program a bit. \nAs an example, let's see what happens if we execute our program with some random numbers as inputs, like, 4, 25, 7, and 9. \nTo see if the program behaves correctly, let's just print the largest and smallest fields. Printing debug information is quite common:\npublic class NumFinderMain {\n\n  public static void main (String[] args) {\n    NumFinder nf = new NumFinder();\n    nf.find(new int[] {4, 25, 7, 9});\n\n    System.out.println(nf.getLargest());\n    System.out.println(nf.getSmallest());\n  }\n}\n\nThe output we get is: 25, 4. This means our software works! We can ship it to our customers! Can we...?\nWe will certainly have problems with this code... Because this implementation does not work for all the possible cases. There's a bug in there! (Can you find the bug? Come back to the code above and look for it!)\nIf we pass an input like 4, 3, 2, and 1; or, in other words, numbers in decreased order, we would get an output like this: -2147483648, 1.\nWe indeed have a bug. Before anything else, let's just fix it.\nIf we go back to the source code, we can see that this bug is \nactually caused by the else if. \npublic class NumFinder {\n  private int smallest = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n  private int largest = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n\n  public void find(int[] nums) {\n    for(int n : nums) {\n      if(n  largest) largest = n;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // getters for smallest and largest\n}\n\nTake a moment here to understand why. This else if should actually just be an if. \nYes, this is indeed a very simple bug. But the point is that those mistakes \ncan and do happen all the time. As developers, we usually deal with very complex software and it is challenging for us to have everything in our minds. \nThis is why we need to test software. Because bugs do happen.\n And they can really have a huge impact in our lifes.\nAnd that is what we are going to focus throughout this course. Hopefully, with everything we are going to teach you, you will have enough knowledge to rigorously test your software, and make sure that bugs like thise one do not happen.\n\n\n\n"},"chapters/getting-started/testing-principles.html":{"url":"chapters/getting-started/testing-principles.html","title":"Principles of software testing","keywords":"","body":"Principles of software testing\nNow that we have some basic tools to design and automate our tests, we can think more about some testing concepts.\nWe start with some precise definitions for certain terms.\nFailure, Fault and Error\nWe can use a lot of different words for a system that is not behaving correctly.\nJust to name a few we have error, mistake, defect, bug, fault and failure.\nAs we like to be able to describe the problem in software precisely, we need to agree on a certain vocabulary.\nFor now this comes down to three terms: failure, fault, and error.\nA failure is a component of the (software) system that is not behaving as expected.\nAn example of a failure is the well-known blue screen of death.\nWe generally expect our pc to keep running, but it just crashes.\nFailures are generally caused by faults.\nFaults are also called defects or bugs.\nA fault is a flaw, or mistake, in a component of the system that can cause the system to behave incorrectly.\nWe have a fault when we have, for example, a > instead of >= in a condition.\nA fault in the code does not have to cause a failure.\nIf the code containing the fault is not being run, it can also not cause a failure.\nFailures only occur when the end user is using the system, when they notice it not behaving as expected.\nFinally we have the error, also called a mistake.\nAn error is a human action that cause the system to run not as expected.\nFor example someone can forget to think about a certain corner case that the code might run into.\nThis then creates a fault in the code, which can result in a failure.\n\n\n\n\n\nVerification and Validation\nWe keep extending our vocabulary a bit with two more concepts.\nHere we introduce verification and validation.\nBoth concepts are about assessing the quality of a system and can be described by a single question.\nValidation: Are we building the right software?\nValidation concerns the features that our system offers and the customer, for who the system is made.\nIs the system that we are building actually the system that the users want?\nIs the system actually useful?\nVerification on the other hand is about the system behaving as it is supposed to according to the specification. \nThis mostly means that the systems behaves without any bugs, like it is said it should behave.\nThis does not guarantee that the system is useful.\nThat is a matter of validation.\nWe can summarize verification with the question: Are we building the system right?\nIn this course, we mostly focus on verification.\nHowever, validation is also very important when it comes to building successful software systems.\n\n\n\n\nTests, tests and more tests\nIf we want to test our systems well, we just keep adding more tests until it is enough, right?\nActually a very important part of software testing is knowing when to stop testing.\nCreating too few tests will leave us with a system that might not behave as intended.\nOn the other hand, creating test after test without stopping will probably cost too much time to create and at some point will make the whole test suite too slow.\nA couple of tests are executed in a very short amount of time, but if the amount of tests becomes very high the time needed to execute them will naturally increase as well.\nWe discuss a couple of important concepts surrounding this subject.\nFirst, exhaustive testing is impossible.\nWe simply cannot test every single case a method might be executing.\nThis means that we have to prioritize the tests that we do run.\nWhen prioritizing the test cases that we make, it is important to notice that bugs are not uniformly distributed.\nIf we have some components in our system, then they will not all have the same amount of bugs.\nSome components probably have more bugs than others.\nWe should think about which components we want to test most when prioritizing the tests.\nA crucial notion for software testing is that testing shows the presence of defects;\nhowever, testing does not show the absence of defects.\nSo while we might find more bugs by testing more, we will never be able to say that our software is 100% bug-free, because of the tests.\nTo test our software we need a lot of variation in our tests.\nWhen testing a method we want variety in the inputs, for example, like we saw in the examples above.\nTo test the software well, however, we also need variation in the testing strategies that we apply.\nThis is described by the pesticide paradox: \"Every method you use to prevent or find bugs leaves a residue of subtler bugs against which those methods are ineffectual.\"\nThere is no testing strategy that guarantees that the tested software is bug-free.\nSo, when using the same strategy all the time, we will miss some of the defects that are in the software.\nThis is the residue that is talked about in the pesticide paradox.\nFrom the pesticide paradox we learn that we have to use different testing strategies on the same software to minimize the bugs left in the software.\nWhen learning the various testing strategies in this reader, keep in mind that you want to combine them when you are testing your software.\nCombining these testing strategies is a great idea, but it can be quite challenging.\nFor example, testing a mobile app is very different from testing a web application or a rocket.\nIn other words: testing is context-dependent.\nThe way that we test depends on the context of the software that we test.\nFinally, while we are mostly focusing on verification when we create tests, we should not forget that just having a low amount of bugs is not enough.\nIf we have a program that works like it is specified, but is of no use for its users, we still do not have good software.\nThis is called the absence-of-errors fallacy.\nWe cannot forget about the validation part, where we check if the software meets the users' needs.\n\n\n\n\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nHaving a certain terminology helps testers to explain the problems they have with a program or in their software.\nBelow is a small conversation.\nFill each of the caps with: failure, fault, or error.\n\nMark: Hey, Jane, I just observed a (1)       in our software: if the user has multiple surnames, our software doesn't allow them to sign in. \nJane: Oh, that's awful. Let me debug the code so that I can find the (2)      .\n(a few minutes later)\nJane: Mark, I found it! It was my (3)      . I programmed that part, but never thought of this case.\nMark: No worries, Jane! Thanks for fixing it!\n\nExercise 2.\nKelly, a very experienced software tester, visits Books!, a social network focused on matching people based on books they read.\nUsers do not report bugs so often; Books! developers have strong testing practices in place.\nHowever, users do say that the software is not really delivering what it promises.\nWhat testing principle applies to this problem?\nExercise 3.\nSuzanne, a junior software testing, just joined a very large online payment company in the Netherlands. As a first task, Suzanne analyzed their past two years of bug reports.\nSuzanne observes that more than 50% of bugs have been happening in the 'International payments module. \nSuzanne then promises her manager that she will design test cases that will completely cover the 'International payments' module, and thus, find \nall the bugs.\nWhich of the following testing principles might explain why this is not possible?\n\nPesticide paradox. \nExhaustive testing.\nTest early.\nDefect clustering.\n\nExercise 4.\nJohn strongly believes in unit testing. In fact, this is the only type of testing he actually\ndoes at any project he's in. All the testing principles below, but one, might help in convincing John that he should also focus on different types of testing. \nWhich of the following is the least related related to help John in moving away from his 'only unit testing' approach?\n\nPesticide paradox. \nTests are context-dependent.\nAbsence-of-errors fallacy.\nTest early.\n\nReferences\n\nChapters 1-3 of the Foundations of software testing: ISTQB certification.

Go ahead and implement them!\n\n\n\n\nThe need for systematic software testing\nWe devised three test cases in our exemple above. How did we do it? We used our experience as software developers.\nHowever, although our experience indeed helps us deeply in finding bugs, this might\nnot be enough: \n\nIt is highly prone to mistakes. Maybe you might forget one test case.\nIt varies from person to person. We want any developer in the world to be able to test software.\nIt is hard to know when to stop, based only on our gut feelings.\n\nThis is why, throughout the course, we will study more systematic techniques \nto test software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn introduction to test code quality\nIn practice, developers write (and maintain!) thousands of test code lines. \nTaking care of the quality of test code is therefore of utmost importance.\nWhenever possible, we'll introduce you to some best practices in test\ncode engineering.\nFor example, in the example above, we create the roman object four times.\nThis is good, because we want to start fresh with each test.\nIf the method would in some way change the object, we do not want this to carry over to another test.\nHowever, now we have the same line of code in each test method.\nThe risk of this code duplication is that we might do it wrong in one of the cases, or if we want to change the code somewhere, we forget to change it everywhere.\nWe can write everything we want to do at the start of each test in just one method.\nIn order to do so, we will use the @BeforeEach annotation.\nLike the tests, we annotate a method with this annotation.\nThen JUnit knows that before it runs the code in a test method is has to run the code in the BeforeEach method.\nIn the test code we just wrote, we can instantiate the roman object inside a method annotated with BeforeEach.\nIn this case it is just one line that we move out of the test methods, but as your tests become more complicated this approach becomes more important.\nThe new test code would look as follows.\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\n\nimport static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;\n\nclass RomanNumeralTest {\n\n  private RomanNumeral roman;\n\n  @BeforeEach\n  void setup() {\n    roman = new RomanNumeral();\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  void convertSingleDigit() {\n    roman = new RomanNumeral();\n    int result = roman.convert(\"C\");\n\n    assertEquals(100, result);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  void convertNumberWithDifferentDigits() {\n    roman = new RomanNumeral();\n    int result = roman.convert(\"CCXVI\");\n\n    assertEquals(216, result);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  void convertNumberWithSubtractiveNotation() {\n    roman = new RomanNumeral();\n    int result = roman.convert(\"XL\");\n\n    assertEquals(40, result);\n  }\n}\n\nWe will discuss test code quality in a more systematic way in a future \nchapter.\nTest design vs test execution\nIn practice, we usually have two distinct \ntasks when performing software testing. \nThe first one is about analysing and designing test cases, where the goal is for us to \nthink about everything we wanna test so that we are sure that our software works as expected.\nUsually, this phase is done by humans, although we will explore the state-of-the-art in software testing research, where machines also try to \ndevise test cases for us. \nWe are going to explore different strategies that a person can do to design good test cases, such as functional testing, boundary testing, and structural testing.\nThe second part is about executing the tests we created. \nAnd we often do it by actually running the real software or by exercising its classes, and making sure that the software does what it is supposed to do.\nAlthough this phase can also be done by humans, this is an activity that we can easily automate. Meaning, we can write a program that run our software and executes the test cases. \nWriting these test programs or, as we call, writing automated tests, is also a fundamental part of this course. \nTo sum up, you should do two activities when testing your software. The first one, the more human part, which is to think and design test cases in the best way possible. And the second phase, which is to execute the tests against the software under test, and make sure that it behaves correctly. And that, we will always try to automate it as much as possible.\nSide note 1: If you're very interested on understanding why it is so hard to teach machines to design test cases for us, and therefore, remove the human out of the loop, you can read this amazing paper called \"The Oracle Problem in Software Testing: A Survey\". \nSide note 2: In industry, the term automated software testing is related to the execution of test cases; in other words, JUnit code. In academia, whenever a research paper says automated software testing, it means automatically designing test cases (and not only the JUnit code).\n\n\n\n\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nImplement the RomanNumeral class. Then, write as many tests as you\ncan for it, using JUnit.\nFor now, do not worry about how to derive test cases. Just follow\nyour intuition. \nExercise 2.\nChoose a problem from Codebat.

The specification below talks\nabout a program that decides\nwhether a year is leap or not. \n\nRequirement: Leap year\nGiven a specific year as an input, the program should return true if the \nthe provided year is leap and false if it is not.\nA year is a leap year if:\n\nthe year is divisible by 4;\nthe year is not divisible by 100;\nexceptions are years that are divisible by 400, which are also leap years.\n\n\nTo find a good set of test cases, often referred to as a test suite,\nwe split the program into classes.\nIn other words, we divide the input space of\nthe program in such a way that each class is 1)\ndifferent, i.e. it is unique, where\nno two partitions represent/exercise the same behavior,\n2) can easily verify whether that behavior is correct or not.\n\nClasses for the leap year problem\nBy looking at the requirements, we can derive the\nfollowing classes/partitions:\n\nYear is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100 = leap year, TRUE\nYear is divisible by 4, divisible by 100, divisible by 400 = leap year, TRUE\nNot divisible by 4 = not a leap year, FALSE\nDivisible by 4, divisible by 100, but not divisible by 400 = not leap year, FALSE\n\nNote how each class above exercises the program in different ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquivalence partitioning\nThe partitions above are not test cases that we can implement directly because\neach partition might be instantiated by an infinite number of inputs. For example,\nfor the partition \"year not divisible by 4\", there are infinite options of numbers\nwhich are not divisible by 4 that we could use as concrete inputs\nto the program.\nIt is impractical to test all of these numbers.\nSo how do we know which concrete input to instantiate for each\nof the partitions?\nAs we discussed earlier, each partition exercises the program in a certain way.\nIn other words, all input values from one specific partition will make the program\nbehave in the same way.\nTherefore, any input we select should give us the same result.\nWe assume that, if the program behaves correctly for one given input,\nit will work correctly for all other inputs from that class.\nThis idea of inputs being equivalent to each other\nis called equivalence partitioning.\nThus, it does not matter which precise input we select and one test case per\npartition will be enough.\nLet’s now write some JUnit tests for the leap year problem. Remember that the name of a test method\nin JUnit can be anything. It is good to name your test method after the \npartition that the method tests.\nWe discuss more about test code quality and best practices in writing test code in\na future chapter.\n\nThe Leap Year specification has been implemented by a developer in the following way:\npublic class LeapYear {\n\n  public boolean isLeapYear(int year) {\n    if (year % 400 == 0)\n      return true;\n    if (year % 100 == 0)\n      return false;\n\n    return year % 4 == 0;\n  }\n}\n\nWith the classes we devised above, we have 4 test cases in total (i.e., one test case\nfor each class/partition).\nAs any input can be used for a given partition,\nthe following inputs will be used for the partitions:\n\n2016, divisible by 4, not divisible by 100.\n2000, divisible by 4, also divisible by 100 and by 400.\n39, not divisible by 4.\n1900, divisible by 4 and 100, not by 400.\n\nImplementing this using JUnit gives the following code for the tests:\npackage tudelft.leapyear;\n\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions;\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\n\npublic class LeapYearTests {\n\n  private LeapYear leapYear;\n\n  @BeforeEach\n  public void setup() {\n    leapYear = new LeapYear();\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void leapYearsNotCenturialTest() {\n    boolean leap = leapYear.isLeapYear(2016);\n\n    assertTrue(leap);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void leapYearsCenturialTest() {\n    boolean leap = leapYear.isLeapYear(2000);\n\n    assertTrue(leap);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void nonLeapYearsTest() {\n    boolean leap = leapYear.isLeapYear(39);\n\n    assertFalse(leap);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void nonLeapYearsCenturialTest() {\n    boolean leap = leapYear.isLeapYear(1900);\n\n    assertFalse(leap);\n  }\n}\n\nNote that each test method covers one of the partitions and the naming of the method refers to the partition it covers.\nFor those who are learning JUnit: Note that the setup method is executed \nbefore each test, thanks to the BeforeEach annotation.\nIt creates the LeapYear.\nThis is then used by the tests to execute the method under test.\nIn each test we first determine the result of the method.\nAfter the method returns a value, we assert that this is the expected value.\n\n\n\n\nCategory-Partition Method\nSo far we derived partitions by just looking at the specification of the program.\nWe basically used our experience and knowledge to derive the test cases.\nWe now go over a more systematic way of deriving these partitions: the Category-Partition method.\nThe method gives us 1) a systematic way of deriving test cases, based on the characteristics of the input parameters, 2) minimize the amount of tests\nto a feasible amount.\nWe set out now the steps of this method and then we illustrate the process with an example.\n\nIdentify the parameters, or the input of the program. For example, the parameters your classes and methods receive.\nDerive characteristics of each parameter. For example, an int year should be a positive integer number between 0 and infinite. \n\nSome of these characteristics can be found directly in the specification of the program.\nOthers might not be found from specifications. For example, an input cannot be null if the method does not handle that well.\n\n\nAdd constraints in order to minimize the test suite.\n\nIdentify invalid combinations. For example, some characterics might not be able to be combined with other characteristics.\nExceptional behavior does not always have to be combined with all the different values of the other inputs. For example, trying a single null input might be enough to test that corner case.\n\n\nGenerate combinations of the input values. These are the test cases.\n\n\nLet's apply the technique in the following program:\n\nRequirement: Christmas discount\nThe system should give 25% discount on the cart when it is Christmas.\nThe method has two input parameters: the total price of the products in the cart, and the date.\nWhen it is not Christmas it just returns the original price, otherwise it applies the discount.\n\nFollowing the category-partition method:\n\nWe have two parameters:\n\nThe current date\nThe total price\n\n\nNow for each parameter we define the characteristics as:\n\nBased on the requirements, the only important characteristic is that the date can be either Christmas or not.\nThe price can be a positive number, or in certain circumstances it may be 0. Technically the price can also be a negative number. This is an exceptional case, as you cannot pay a negative amount.\n\n\nThe amount of characteristics and parameters is not too large in this case.\nAs the negative price is an exceptional case, we can test this with just one combination, instead of with a date that is Christmas and a date that is not Christmas.\n\nWe combine the other characteristics to get the following test cases:\n\nPositive price on Christmas\nPositive price not on Christmas\nPrice of 0 on Christmas\nPrice of 0 not on Christmas\nNegative price on Christmas\n\n\n\nNow we can implement these test cases.\nEach of the test cases corresponds to one of the partitions that we want to test.\n\n\n\nLet's explore another example:\n\nChocolate bars\nA package should store a total number of kilos. \nThere are small bars (1 kilo each) and big bars (5 kilos each). \nWe should calculate the number of small bars to use, \nassuming we always use big bars before small bars. Return -1 if it is impossible.\nThe input of the program is thus the number of small bars, the number of big bars,\nand the total amount of kilos to store.\n\nIn this example, the partitions are less clear and it is essential to understand the problem fully\nin order to derive the partitions.\nThe classes/partitions are:\n\nNeed only small bars. A solution that only uses the provided small bars.\nNeed only big bars. A solution that only uses the provided big bars.\nNeed Small + big bars. A solution that has to use both small and big bars.\nNot enough bars. A case in which it is impossible, because there are not enough bars.\nNot from the specs: An exceptional case.\n\nFor each of these classes, we can devise concrete test cases:\n\nNeed only small bars. small = 4, big = 2, total = 3\nNeed only big bars. small = 5, big = 3, total = 10\nNeed Small + big bars. small = 5, big = 3, total = 17\nNot enough bars. small = 1, big = 1, total = 10\nNot from the specs: small = 4, big = 2, total = -1\n\nThis example shows why deriving good test cases becomes more challenging, \nwhen the specifications are complex.\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom testing vs specification-based testing\nOne might think: but what if, instead of looking at the requirements,\na tester just keeps giving random inputs to the program?\nRandom testing is indeed a popular black-box technique where programs are tested by generating random inputs. \nAlthough random testing can definitely help us in finding bugs, it is not an effective way to find bugs in a large input space. \nDevelopers/testers use their experience and knowledge of the program to test trouble-prone areas more effectively.\nHowever, they generate a limited number of tests in a specific time period such as a day,\nwhile computers can generate millions.\nA combination of random testing and partition testing is therefore the most beneficial.\nIn future chapters, fuzzing testing and AI-based testing will be discussed, with information\nabout automated random testing.\n\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nWhat is an Equivalence Partition?\n\nA group of results that is produced by one method\nA group of results that is produced by one input into different methods\nA group of inputs that all make a method behave the same way\nA group of inputs that exactly gives the same output in every method\n\nExercise 2.\nWe have a program called FizzBuzz.\nIt does the following:\nGiven an int n, return the string form of the number followed by \"!\".\nSo the int 6 yields \"6!\".\nExcept if the number is divisible by 3 use \"Fizz\" instead of the number, and if the number is divisible by 5 use \"Buzz\", and if divisible by both 3 and 5, use \"FizzBuzz\".\nA novice tester is trying hard to devise as many tests as she can for\nthe FizzBuzz method.\nShe came up with the following tests:\n\nT1 = 15\nT2 = 30\nT3 = 8\nT4 = 6\nT5 = 25\n\nWhich of these tests can be removed while keeping a good test suite?\nWhich concept can we use to determine the tests that can be removed?\nExercise 3.\nSee a slightly modified version of HashMap's put method Javadoc. (Source code here).\n/**\n * Puts the supplied value into the Map,\n * mapped by the supplied key.\n * If the key is already on the map, its\n * value will be replaced by the new value.\n *\n * NOTE: Nulls are not accepted as keys;\n *  a RuntimeException is thrown when key is null.\n *\n * @param key the key used to locate the value\n * @param value the value to be stored in the HashMap\n * @return the prior mapping of the key, or null if there was none.\n */\npublic V put(K key, V value) {\n  // implementation here\n}\n\nApply the category/partition method.\nWhat are the minimal and most suitable partitions?\nExercise 4.\nZip codes in country X are always composed of 4 numbers + 2 letters, e.g., 2628CD.\nNumbers are in the range [1000, 4000].\nLetters are in the range [C, M].\nConsider a program that receives two inputs: an integer (for the 4 numbers) and a string (for the 2 letters), and returns true (valid zip code) or false (invalid zip code).\nA tester comes up with the following partitions:\n\n[0,999]\n[1000, 4000]\n[2001, 3500]\n[3500, 3999]\n[4001, 9999]\n[A-C]\n[C-M]\n[N-Z]\n\nNote that with [a, b] all numbers between and including a and b are in the domain.\nThe same goes with letters like [A-Z].\nWhich of these partitions are valid (and good) partitions, i.e. which can actually be used as partitions?\nName each of the valid partitions, corresponding to how they exercise the program.\nExercise 5.\nSee a slightly modified version of HashSet's add()'s Javadoc below.\nApply the category/partition method. What is the minimal and most suitable partitions for the e input parameter? \n/**\n * Adds the specified element to this set if it \n * is not already present.\n * If this set already contains the element, \n * the call leaves the set unchanged\n * and returns false.\n *\n * If the specified element is NULL, the call leaves the\n * set unchanged and returns false.\n *\n * @param e element to be added to this set\n * @return true if this set did not already contain \n *   the specified element\n */\npublic boolean add(E e) {\n    // implementation here\n}\n\nExercise 6.\nWhich of the following statements is false about applying the category/partition method in method below?\n/**\n * Puts the supplied value into the Map, \n * mapped by the supplied key.\n * If the key is already on the map, its\n * value will be replaced by the new value.\n *\n * NOTE: Nulls are not accepted as keys; \n *  a RuntimeException is thrown when key is null.\n *\n * @param key the key used to locate the value\n * @param value the value to be stored in the HashMap\n * @return the prior mapping of the key, \n *  or null if there was none.\n */\npublic V put(K key, V value) {\n  // implementation here\n}\n\n\nThe specification does not specify any details about the value input parameter, and thus, experience should be used to partition it, e.g., value being null and not null.\n\nThe number of tests generated by the category/partition method can grow quickly, as the chosen partitions for each category are later combined one-by-one. This is not a practical problem to the put() method because the number of categories and their partitions is small.\n\nIn an object-oriented language, besides using the method's input parameters to explore partitions, we should also consider the internal state of the object (i.e., the class's attributes), as it can also affect the behavior of the method.\n\nWith the information in hands, it is not possible to perform the category/partition method, as the source code is required for the last step of the category/partition method: adding constraints.\n\n\nExercise 7.\nWith a find program that finds occurrences of a pattern in a file, the program has the following syntax:\nfind  \nA tester, after reading the specs and following the Category-Partition method, devised the following test specification:\n\nPattern size: empty, single character, many characters, longer than any line in the file.\nQuotting: pattern is quoted, pattern is not quoted, pattern is improperly quoted.\nFile name: good file name, no file name with this name, omitted.\nOccurrences in the file: none, exactly one, more than one.\nOccurrences in a single line, assuming line contains the pattern: one, more than one.\n\nHowever, the number of combinations is now too high.

This is the value we see in the condition.\nOff-point: the value closest to the boundary that flips the conditions. So if the on-point makes the condition true, the off point makes it false and vice versa. Note: when dealing with equalities or non equalities (e.g. x==6x == 6x==6 or x!=6x != 6x!=6), there are two off-points; one in each direction.\nIn-points are all the values that make the condition true.\nOut-points are all the values that make the condition false.\n\nNote that, depending on the condition, an on-point can be either an in- or an out-point.\nExample: Suppose we have a program that adds shipping costs when the total price is below 100.\nThe condition used in the program is x100x x100.\n\nThe on-point is 100100100, as that is the value in the condition.\nThe on-point makes the condition false, so the off-point should be the closest number that makes the condition true.\nThis will be 999999,  9910099 99100 is true.\nThe in-points are all the values smaller than or equal to 999999.\nThe out-points are all values larger than or equal to 100100100.\n\nWe show all these points in the diagram below.\n\nNow, let's compare it to the next condition x=100x x=100 (note how similar they are; the only difference is that, in this one, we use smaller than or equals to):\n\nThe on-point is still 100100100: this is the point in the condition\nNow the condition is true for the on-point. So, the off-point should make the condition false; the off-point is 101101101.\n\n\nNote that, in the diagram, the on-point is part of the in-points, and the off-point is part of the out-points.\n\nAs a tester, you devise test cases for these different points.\nNow that we know the meaning of these different points we can start the boundary analysis in more complicated cases.\nIn the previous example, we looked at one condition and its boundary.\nHowever, in most programs you will find statements that consist of multiple conditions.\nTo test the boundaries in these more complicated decisions, we use the simplified domain testing strategy.\nThe idea of this strategy is to test each boundary separately, i.e. independent of the other conditions.\nTo do so, for each boundary:\n\nWe pick the on- and off-point and we create one test case each.\nIf we use multiple variables, we need values for those as well.\nAs we want to test each boundary independently, we choose in-points for the other variables. Note: We always choose in points, regardless\nof the two boolean expressions being connected by ANDs or ORs. In practice, we want all the other conditions to return true, so that\nwe can evaluate the outcome of the condition under test independently.\nIt is important to vary these in-points and to not choose the on- or off-point.\nThis gives us the ability to partially check that the program gives the correct results for some in-points.\nIf we would set the in-point to the on- or off-point, we would be testing two boundaries at once.\n\nTo find these values and display the test cases in a structured manner, we use a domain matrix.\nIn general the table looks like the following:\n\nIn this template, we have two conditions with two parameters (see the x>a∧y>bx > a \\land y > bx>a∧y>b condition).\nWe list the variables, with all their conditions.\nThen each condition has two rows: one for the on-point and one for the off-point.\nEach variable has an additional row for the typical (or in-) values.\nThese are used when testing the other boundary.\nEach column that corresponds to a test case has two colored cells.\nIn the colored cells you have to fill in the correct values.\nEach of these pairs of values will then give a test case.\nIf we implement all the test cases that the domain matrix gives us, we exerise each boundary both for the on- and off-point independent of the other parameters.\nExample.\nWe have the following condition that we want to test: x >= 5 && x \nWe start by making the domain matrix, having space for each of the conditions and both parameters.\n\nHere you see that we need 6 test cases, because there are 3 conditions.\nNow it is time to fill in the table.\nWe get the on- and off-points like in the previous example.\n\nNow we have derived the six test cases that we can use to test the boundaries.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoundaries that are not so explicit\nLet's revisit the example from the specification-based techniques chapter. There, we had a program\nwhere the goal was to return the amount of bars needed in order to build some boxes of chocolates:\n\nChocolate bars\nA package should store a total number of kilos. \nThere are small bars (1 kilo each) and big bars (5 kilos each). \nWe should calculate the number of small bars to use, \nassuming we always use big bars before small bars. Return -1 if it can't be done.\nThe input of the program is thus the number of small bars, the number of big bars,\nand the total amount of kilos to store.\n\nAnd these were the classes we derived after applying the category/partition method:\n\nNeed only small bars. A solution that only uses the provided small bars.\nNeed only big bars. A solution that only uses the provided big bars.\nNeed Small + big bars. A solution that has to use both small and big bars.\nNot enough bars. A case in which it's not possible, because there are not enough bars.\nNot from the specs: An exceptional case.\n\nA developer implemented the following code for the requirement, and all the tests pass.\npublic int calculate(int small, int big, int total) {\n  int maxBigBoxes = total / 5;\n  int bigBoxesWeCanUse = maxBigBoxes \nHowever, another developer tried (2,3,17) as an input and the program crashed. After some debugging,\nthey noticed that the if statement should had been if(small  instead of\nif(small . This smells like a bug that could had been caught via boundary testing!\nNote that the test (2,3,17) belongs to the need small + big bars partition. In this case,\nthe program will make use of all the big bars (there are 3 available) and then all the small bars available (there are \n2 available). Note that the buggy program would work if we had 3 available small bars (having (3, 3, 17) as input).\nThis is a boundary.\nHow can we apply boundary testing here? \n\nBoundaries also happen when we are going from \"one partition\" to \nanother. \nIn these cases, what we should do is to devise test cases for a sequence of inputs that move\nfrom one partition to another.\nFor example, let's focus on the bug caused by the (2,3,17) input.\n\n(1,3,17) should return not possible (1 small bar is not enough). This test case belongs to the not enough bars partition.\n(2,3,17) should return 2. This test case belongs to need for small + big bars partition.\n\nThere is a boundary between the (1,3,17) and the (2,3,17). We should make sure the software still behaves correctly in these cases.\nLet's explore another boundary. Let's focus on the only big bars partition. We should find inputs that transition from this\npartition to another one:\n\n(10, 1, 10) returns 5. This input belongs to the need small + big bars partition.\n(10, 2, 10) returns 0. This input belongs to the need only big bars partition.\n\nOne more? Let's focus on the only small bars partition:\n\n(3, 2, 3) returns 3. We need only small bars here, and therefore, this input belongs to the only small bars partition.\n(2, 2, 3) returns -1. We can't make the boxes. This input belongs to the Not enough bars partition.\n\nA partition might make boundaries with other partitions. See:\n\n(4, 2, 4) returns 4. We need only small bars here, and therefore, this input belongs to the only small bars partition.\n(4, 2, 5) returns 0. We need only bigs bars here, and therefore, this input belongs to the only big bars partition.\n\nYour lesson is: explore the boundaries in between your partitions!\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomating boundary testing with JUnit (via Parameterized Tests)\nWe just analysed the boundaries and derived test cases using a domain matrix.\nIt is time to automated these tests using JUnit.\nYou might have noticed that in the domain matrix we always have a certain amount of input values and, implicitly, an expected output value.\nWe could just implement the boundary tests by making a separate method for each test.\nHowever, the amount of tests can quickly become large and then this approach is not maintainable.\nAlso, the code in these test methods will be largely the same.\nAfter all, we do the same thing with just different input and output values.\nLuckily, JUnit offers a solution where we can implement the tests with just one method: Parameterized Tests.\nAs the naming suggests, with a parameterized test we can make a test method with parameters.\nSo we can create a test method and make it act based on the arguments we give the method.\nTo define a parameterized test you can use the @ParameterizedTest annotation instead of the usual @Test annotation.\nNow that we have a test method that has some parameters, we have to give it the values that it should execute the tests with.\nIn general these values are provided by a Source.\nHere we focus and a certain kind of Source, namely the CsvSource.\nWith the CsvSource, each test case is given as a comma separated list of input values.\nWe give this list in a string.\nTo execute multiple test with the same test method, the CsvSource expects list of strings, where each string represents the values for one test case.\nThe CsvSource is an annotation itself, so in an implementation it would like like the following: @CsvSource({\"value11, value12\", \"value21, value22\", \"value31, value32\", ...})\nWe are going to implement the test cases that we found in the previous example using the parameterized test.\nSuppose we are testing a method that returns the result of the decision we analyzed in the example.\nTo automate the tests we create a test method with three parameters: x, y, expectedResult.\nx and y are integers.\nThe expectedResult is a boolean, as the result of the method is also a boolean.\n@ParameterizedTest\n@CsvSource({\n  \"5, 24, true\",\n  \"4, 13, false\",\n  \"20, -75, false\",\n  \"19, 48, true\",\n  \"15, 89, true\",\n  \"8, 90, false\"\n})\npublic void exampleTest(int x, int y, boolean expectedResult) {\n  Example example = new Example();\n\n  assertEquals(expectedResult, example.run(x, y))\n}\n\nThe assertion in the test checks if the result of the method, with the x and y values, is the expected result.\nFrom the values you can see that each of the six test cases corresponds to one of the test cases in the domain matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CORRECT way\nThe Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java 8 with JUnit, by Langr, Hunt, and Thomas, has an interesting discussion about boundary conditions.\nAuthors call it the CORRECT way, as each letter represents one boundary condition you should consider:\n\nConformance: \n\nMany data elements must conform to a specific format. Example: e-mail (always name@domain). If you expect an e-mail, and you do not\nreceive an e-mail, your software might crash.\nWhat should we do? Test when your input is not in conformance with what is expected.\n\n\nOrdering:\n\nSome inputs might come in specific orders. Imagine a system that receives different products to be inserted in a basket. The order of the data might influence the output. What happens if the list is ordered? Unordered?\nWhat should we do? Make sure our program works even if the data comes in an unordered manner (or return an elegant failure to user, avoiding the crash).\n\n\nRange:\n\nInputs often should usually be within a certain range. Example: Age should always be greater than 0 and smaller than 120.\nWhat should we do? Test what happens when we provide inputs that are outside of the expected range.\n\n\n\n\nReference:\n\nIn OOP systems, objects refer to other objects. Sometimes these relationships get very deep. Moreover, we might depend on\nexternal dependencies. What happens if these dependencies don't behave as expected?\nWhat should we do? When testing a method, consider:\nWhat it references outside its scope\nWhat external dependencies it has\nWhether it depends on the object being in a certain state\nAny other conditions that must exist\n\n\n\n\nExistence:\n\nDoes something really exist? What if it doesn't? Imagine you query a database, and your database returns empty. Will our software\nbehave correctly?\nWhat should we do? What happens if we something we are expecting does not really exist?\n\n\n\n\nCardinality:\n\nBasically, the famous off-by-one errors. In simple words, our loop performed one step less (or more) than it should.\nWhat should we do? Make sure we test our loops in different situations, such as when it actually performs zero iterations,\none iterations, or many. (We'll discuss more about loops in the structural-based testing chapter).\n\n\nTime\n\nMany perspectives here. First, systems rely a lot on dates and times. What happens if we receive inputs that are not\nordered in regards to date and time?\nTimeouts: does our system handle timeouts well?\nConcurrency: does our system handle concurrency well?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nWe have the following method.\npublic String sameEnds(String string) {\n  int length = string.length();\n  int half = length / 2;\n\n  String left = \"\";\n  String right = \"\";\n\n  int size = 0;\n  for(int i = 0; i \nPerform boundary analysis on the condition in the for-loop: i , i.e. what are the on- and off-point and the in- and out-points?\nYou can give the points in terms of the variables used in the method.\nExercise 2.\nPerform boundary analysis on the following decision: n % 3 == 0 && n % 5 == 0.\nWhat are the on- and off-points?\nExercise 3.\nA game has the following condition: numberOfPoints .\nPerform boundary analysis on the condition.\nWhat are the on- and off-point of the condition?\nAlso give an example for both an in-point and an out-point.\nExercise 4.\nWe extend the game with a more complicated condition: (numberOfPoints  10) || energyLevel == 5.\nPerform boundary analysis on this condition.\nWhat is the resulting domain matrix?\nExercise 5.\nRegarding boundary analysis of inequalities (e.g., a ), which of the following statements is true?\n\nThere can only be a single on-point which always makes the condition true.\nThere can be multiple on-points for a given condition which may or may not make the condition true.\nThere can only be a single off-point which may or may not make the condition false.\nThere can be multiple off-points for a given condition which always make the condition false.\n\nExercise 6.\nA game has the following condition: numberOfPoints > 1024. Perform a boundary analysis.\nExercise 7.\nWhich one of the following statements about the CORRECT principles is true?\n\nWe should suppose that external dependencies are already on the right state for the test (REFERENCE).\nWe should test different methods from the same class in an isolated way in order to avoid order issues (TIME).\nWhenever we encounter a loop, we should always test whether the program works for 0, 1, and 10 iterations (CARDINALITY).\nWe should always test the behavior of our program when any expected data actually does not exist (EXISTENCE).\n\nReferences\n\nJeng, B., & Weyuker, E.

These coverage criteria\nare highly related to test coverage, a concept that many developers know.\nBy test coverage, we mean the amount (or percentage) of production code that is exercised by the tests.\nWe will cover the following coverage criteria:\n\nLine coverage (and statement coverage)\nBlock coverage\nBranch/Decision coverage\nCondition (Basic and Condition+Branch) coverage\nPath coverage\nMC/DC coverage\n\nWatch a summary of one of our lectures in structural testing!\n\n\n\nLine (and statement) coverage\nAs the name suggests, when determining the line coverage, we look at the amount of lines of code that are covered by the tests (more specifically,\nby at least one test).\nSee the following example: We consider a piece of code that returns the points of the person that wins a game of Black jack.\npublic class BlackJack {\n  public int play(int left, int right) {\n1.  int ln = left;\n2.  int rn = right;\n3.  if (ln > 21)\n4.    ln = 0;\n5.  if (rn > 21)\n6.    rn = 0;\n7.  if (ln > rn)\n8.    return ln;\n9.  else\n10.   return rn;\n  }\n}\n\nThe play(int left, int right) method receives the amount of points of two players and returns the value like specified.\nNow let's make two tests for this method.\npublic class BlackJackTests {\n  @Test\n  public void bothPlayersGoTooHigh() {\n    int result = new BlackJack().play(30, 30);\n    assertThat(result).isEqualTo(0);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void leftPlayerWins() {\n    int result = new BlackJack().play(10, 9);\n    assertThat(result).isEqualTo(10);\n  }\n}\n\nTry to follow each test method and mark which lines of the production code are exercised by it.\nThe first test executes lines 1-7, 9, and 10 as both values are higher than 21 and when the program arrives at line 7.\nln equals rn so the statement ln > rn is false.\nThis means that 9 out of the 10 lines are covered and the line coverage is 910⋅100%=90%\\frac{9}{10}\\cdot100\\% = 90\\%​10​​9​​⋅100%=90% (after all, the test\nexercised 9 out of the 10 lines of that method).\nLine 8 is therefore the only line that the first test does not cover.\nThe second test, leftPlayerWins, complements the first test, and executes lines 1-3, 5, 7 and 8.\nSo when we execute both of our tests, the line coverage is 100%100\\%100%.\nMore formally, we can compute line coverage \nas: \nline coverage=lines coveredlines total⋅100%\\text{line coverage} = \\frac{\\text{lines covered}}{\\text{lines total}} \\cdot 100\\%line coverage=​lines total​​lines covered​​⋅100%\nNote: Defining what constitutes a line is up to the tester. One might count, for example, the method declaration as a code line. \nWe prefer not to count the method declaration line.\n\n\n\n\nWhy is line coverage a bit problematic?\nUsing lines of code as a way to determine line coverage is a simple and straightforward idea.\nHowever, counting the covered lines is not always a good way of calculating the coverage.\nThe amount of lines in a piece of code is heavily dependent on the programmer that writes the code.\nIn Java, for example, you can often write a whole method in just one line (for your future colleagues' sake, please don't).\nIn that case, the line coverage would always be 100%100\\%100% if you test the method.\nWe are again looking at Black Jack example.\nThe play method can also be written in 6 lines, instead of 10:\npublic int play(int left, int right) {\n1.  int ln = left;\n2.  int rn = right;\n3.  if (ln > 21) ln = 0;\n4.  if (rn > 21) rn = 0;\n5.  if (ln > rn) return ln;\n6.  else return rn;\n}\n\nThe same leftPlayerWins test covered 610\\frac{6}{10}​10​​6​​ lines in the first play method.\nNow, it covers lines 1-5, so 56\\frac{5}{6}​6​​5​​ lines.\nThe line coverage went up from 60%60\\%60% to 83%83\\%83%, while testing the same method with the same test.\nThis is definitely not ideal.\nWe need a better representation for source code. One that is independent of the developers' personal\ncode styles.\nNote: Some coverage tools measure coverage as statement level. Statements are the unique instructions that your\nJVM, for example, executes. This is a bit better, as splitting one line code in two would not make a difference, \nbut still not good enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlocks and Control-Flow Graph\nA Control-Flow Graph (or CFG) is an agnostic representation of a piece of code. \nIt consists of basic blocks, decision blocks, and arrows that connect these blocks.\nA basic block is composed of \"all statements that are executed together\", with no if or for conditions that might\ncreate different branches in the code. Basic blocks are often represented with a square.\nA decision block, on the other hand, represents all the statements in the source\ncode that can create different branches. Decision blocks are often represented as diamonds.\nWe then connect the blocks according to the flow of the program. A basic block has always a single outgoing edge; a decision block has\nalways two outgoing edges (where you go in case of the decision being evaluated to true, and where you go in case the decision being evaluated\nto false).\nYou can see an example of a CFG below.\nWe write a program for the following problem:\nGiven a sentence, you should count the number of words that end with either an \"s\" or an \"r\".\nA word ends when a non-letter appears.\npublic class CountLetters {\n  public int count(String str) {\n1.  int words = 0;\n2.  char last = ' ';\n3.  for (int i = 0; i \nThe corresponding CFG:\n\nNote that we split the for-loop into two blocks (variable initialization, and increment) and a decision.\nEvery decision has one outgoing arrow for true and one for false, indicating what the program will do based on the condition.\nreturn words; does not have an outgoing arrow as the program stops after that statement.\nNote how agnostic this CFG representation is. You can even build CFGs of program written in different\nlanguages. They might even look the same!\nrecord a video explaining how to build CFGs\n\nBlock coverage\nWe can use blocks as a coverage criteria, in the same way we did with lines: instead of aiming at covering\n100% of the lines, we aim at covering 100% of the blocks.\nThe formula to measure block coverage is similar:\nblock coverage=blocks coveredblocks total⋅100%\\text{block coverage} = \\frac{\\text{blocks covered}}{\\text{blocks total}} \\cdot 100\\%block coverage=​blocks total​​blocks covered​​⋅100%\nNote that blocks do not depend on how the developer wrote the code. Thus, we will not suffer from\nhaving different coverage numbers just because the developer wrote the code in a different way.\nFor the CountLetters program, a test T1 = \"cats and dogs\" exercises all the blocks, and thus,\nreaches 100% block coverage.\nBranch/Decision coverage\nComplex programs often use a lot of conditions (e.g. if-statements).\nWhen testing these programs, aiming at 100% line or block coverage might not be enough to cover all the cases we want.\nWe need a stronger criteria.\nBranch coverage works the same as line and statement coverage.\nThis time, however, we do not count lines or blocks, but the number of possible decision outcomes our program has.\nWhenever you have a decision block, that decision block has two outcomes. We consider our test suite to achieve\n100% branch coverage (or decision coverage, as both terms mean the same) whenever we have tests exercising all the possible outcomes.\nbranch coverage=decision outcomes covereddecision outcomes total⋅100%\\text{branch coverage} = \\frac{\\text{decision outcomes covered}}{\\text{decision outcomes total}} \\cdot 100\\%branch coverage=​decision outcomes total​​decision outcomes covered​​⋅100%\nIn practice, these decisions (or branches) are easy to find in a CFG.\nEach arrow with true of false (so each arrow going out of a decision) is a branch.\nLet's aim at 100% branch coverage for the count method above. \npublic class CountLettersTests {\n  @Test\n  public void multipleMatchingWords() {\n\n    int words = new CountLetters()\n        .count(\"cats|dogs\");\n\n    assertEquals(2, words);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void lastWordDoesntMatch() {\n\n    int words = new CountLetters()\n        .count(\"cats|dog\");\n\n    assertEquals(1, words);\n  }\n}\n\nThe first test (by providing cats|dogs as input) covers all the branches in the left part of the CFG.\nAt the right part, it covers the top false branch, because at some point i will be equals to str.length().\nThen the word dogs ends with an s, so it also covers the true branch on the right side of the CFG.\nThis gives the test 56⋅100%=83%\\frac{5}{6} \\cdot 100\\% = 83\\%​6​​5​​⋅100%=83% branch coverage.\nThe only branch that is not covered is the false branch at the bottom right of the CFG.\nThis branch is executed when the last word does not end with an r or an s.\nThe second test executes this branch (by giving the word cats|dog) so the two tests together have a branch/decision coverage of 100%100\\%100%.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: In the video, we use squares to represent decision blocks. We did it just because otherwise the control flow graph would not fit in the video. When doing control flow graphs, please use diamonds to represent decision blocks.\n(Basic) condition coverage\nBranch coverage gives two branches for each decision, no matter how complicated this decision is.\nWhen a decision gets complicated, i.e., it contains more than one condition like a > 10 && b , \nbranch coverage might not be enough to test all the possible outcomes of all these decisions. Look at this example:\na test T1 (a=20, b=10, c=5) and a test T2 (a=5, b=10, c=5) already covers this decision block. However, look how many\nother possibilities we have for this branch to be evaluated to false (e.g., T3 (a=20, b=30, c=5), ...).\nWhen using condition coverage as criteria, we split the decisions into single conditions. \nInstead of having one big decision block with the entire condition, we have multiple decision blocks, each one\nof one condition only. In practice, now we will exercise each condition separately, and not only the \"big decision block\".\nAs soon as you have the new CFG, it works the same as branch coverage. The formula is basically the same, but now we just have more\ndecision outcomes to count: \ncondition coverage=conditions outcome coveredconditions outcome total⋅100%\\text{condition coverage} = \\frac{\\text{conditions outcome covered}}{\\text{conditions outcome total}} \\cdot 100\\%condition coverage=​conditions outcome total​​conditions outcome covered​​⋅100%\nWe achieve 100% condition coverage whenever all the outcomes of all the conditions in our program have been exercised.\nIn other words, whenever all the conditions have been true and false at least once.\nOnce again we look at the program that counts the words ending with an \"r\" or an \"s\".\nInstead of branch coverage, we are interested in the condition coverage that the tests give.\nWe start by building the more fine-grained CFG:\n\nYou can see that this new CFG has way more decision blocks than the previous one.\nThe first test we wrote before now covers 7 conditions and the total amount of conditions is 12.\nSo the condition coverage is now: 712⋅100%=58%\\frac{7}{12} \\cdot 100\\% = 58\\%​12​​7​​⋅100%=58%.\nThis is significantly less than the 83%83\\%83% branch coverage, so we need more tests to get to 100% condition coverage.\nCondition coverage is an improvement over the branch coverage.\nHowever, we will try to do even better in the next section.\nCondition + Branch coverage\nLet's think carefully about condition coverage. If we only focus on exercising the individual conditions themselves, but do not\nthink of the overall decision, we might end up in a situation like the one below.\nImagine a if(a > 10 && b > 20) condition. A test T1 = (20, 10) makes the first condition a > 10 to be true, and the\nsecond condition b > 20 to be false. A test T2 = (5, 30) makes the first condition to be false, and the second condition to\nbe true. Note that T1 and T2 together achieve 100% basic condition coverage; after all, both conditions have been exercised\nas true and false. However, the final outcome of the entire decision was also false! This means, we found a case where\nwe achieved 100% basic condition coverage, but only 50% branch coverage! This is no good. This is way we called it\nbasic condition coverage.\nIn practice, whenever we use condition coverage, we actually do branch + condition coverage. In other words, we make sure\nthat we achieve 100% condition coverage (i.e., all the outcomes of all conditions are exercised) and 100% branch coverage (all the outcomes\nof the decisions are exercised).\nFrom now on, whenever we mention condition coverage, we mean condition + branch coverage.\n\n\n\n\nrecord a video showing, in a explicit way, the difference between basic condition coverage and full condition coverage\n\nPath coverage\nFinally, with condition coverage, we looked at each condition individually. This gives us way more branches\nto generate tests. However, note that, although we are testing each condition to be evaluated to true and to false,\nthis does not ensure that we are testing all the paths that a program can have.\nPath coverage does not consider the conditions individually; rather, it considers the (full) combination of the conditions in a decision.\nEach of these combinations is a path. You might see a path as a unique way to traverse the CFG.\nThe calculation is the same as the other coverages: \npath coverage=paths coveredpaths total⋅100%\\text{path coverage} = \\frac{\\text{paths covered}}{\\text{paths total}} \\cdot 100\\%path coverage=​paths total​​paths covered​​⋅100%\nSee the following example.\nIn this example we focus on a small piece of the count method:\nif (!Character.isLetter(str.charAt(i)) \n        && (last == 's' || last == 'r')) {\n    words++;\n}\n\nThe decision of this if-statement contains three conditions and can be generalized to (A && ( B || C)), with A = !Character.isLetter(str.charAt(i)), B = last == 's' and C = last == 'r'.\nTo get 100%100\\%100% path coverage, we would have to test all the possible combinations of these three conditions.\nWe construct a truth table to find the combinations:\n\n    TestsABCOutcome\n    1TTTT\n    2TTFT\n    3TFTT\n    4TFFF\n    5FTTF\n    6FTFF\n    7FFTF\n    8FFFF\n\n\nThis means that, for full path coverage, we would need 8 tests just to cover this if-statement.\nThat is quite a lot for just a single statement!\nBy thinking about the path coverage of our test suite, we can come up of quite some good tests.\nThe main issue is that achiving 100% path coverage might not always be feasible. The number of combinations\nmight be too big!\nThe amount of tests needed for full path coverage will grow exponentially with the amount of conditions in a decision.\n\n\n\n\nMC/DC (Modified Condition/Decision Coverage)\nModified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC from now on), looks at the combinations of conditions like path coverage does.\nHowever, instead of aiming at testing all the possible combinations, we take a certain selection process in order \nto identify the \"important ones\". Clearly, the goal of focusing on the important ones is to tackle the large amount\nof test cases that one needs to devise when aiming at 100% path coverage.\nThe idea of MC/DC is to simply exercise each condition in a way that it can, independently of the other conditions,\naffect the outcome of the entire decision. This might sound a bit complicated, but the example will clarify it.\nAnd interestingly, if our conditions have only a binary outcome, which is our case here, as conditions\neither return true or false, the number of tests we will need for that is always \"only\" N+1, where N is the number of conditions in the program. \nN+1N+1N+1 is definitely smaller than N2N^2N​2​​! \nAgain, to devise a test suite that achieves 100% MC/DC coverage, we should select N+1N+1N+1 combinations of inputs where all the conditions\ncan independently affect the outcome.\nLet's do it in a mechanical way. See the example below.\nLet's test the decision block we have in the previous example, with its corresponding truth table. Note how each row\nrepresents a test TnT_nT​n​​. In this case, tests go from 1 to 8, as we have 3 decisions, and 232^32​3​​ is 8:\n\n    TestsABCOutcome\n    1TTTT\n    2TTFT\n    3TFTT\n    4TFFF\n    5FTTF\n    6FTFF\n    7FFTF\n    8FFFF\n\n\nOur goal will be to select N+1N+1N+1, in this case, 3+1=43+1=43+1=4, tests.\nWe go condition by condition.\nIn this case, we start with selecting the pairs of combinations (or tests) for condition A:\n\nIn test 1: A, B and C are all true and the outcome is true as well. We should look for another test in this\ntable, where the value of A is flipped in comparison to test 1, but all others (B and C) are the same. In this case,\nwe should look for a row where A=False, B=True, C=True. We find it in test 5. Now, look at the outcome of test 5: it's false.\nThis means we just found a pair of tests, T1 and T5, where A is the only condition that changed, and the outcome also changed.\nThis means, we just found a pair of tests where A independently affect the outcome. Let's keep the pair {T1, T5} in our list of tests.\n\nNow we look at the next test.\nIn test 2, A is again true, B is true, and C is false. We repeat the process: we search for a test where A is flipped\nin comparison to test 2, but B and C are the same (B=True, C=False).\nWe find test 6.\nThe outcome from test 6 (false) is not the same as the outcome of test 2 (true), so this means that the pair of tests {T2, T6} is also able\nto independently show how A can affect the final outcome.\n\nWe repeat the process for test 3. We will find that the pair {T3, T7} is also a good one.\n\nWe repeat the process for test 4 (A=True, B=False, C=False). Its pair is test 8 (A=False, B=False, C=False). However, note that\nthe outcome of both tests is false. This means that the pair {T4, T8} does not really show how A can independently affect the outcome; after all,\nA is the only thing that changes, but the outcome is still the same...\n\nWe now repeat it up to test 8. We will not find any other suitable pair. \n\nNow that we are done with condition A, we can go to condition B. And we repeat the same process, but now flipping the input of B, and keeping\nA and C the same.\n\nFor T1 (A=true, B=true, C=true), we search for a test where (A=true, B=false, C=true). We find test 3. However, the outcome is the same,\nso the pair {T1, T3} is not a good one to show the independence of B.\n\nYou will only find the pair {T2, T4} for combition B.\n\nThe final condition is C. Here also only one pair of combinations will work, which is {T3, T4}. (To practice, you should do the entire process!)\n\nWe now have all the pairs for each of the conditions:\n\nA: {1, 5}, {2, 6}, {3, 7}\nB: {2, 4}\nC: {3, 4}\n\n\nNow we are ready to select the combinations that we want to test.\nFor each condition (A, B, and C), we have to have at least one of the pairs. Moreover, we want to minimize the total amount of tests, and we know\nthat we can do it with N+1 tests.\n\nWe do not have any choices with conditions B and C, as we only found one pair for each.\nThis means that we have to test combinations 2, 3 and 4.\n\nNow we need to make sure to cover a pair of A.\nTo do so we can either add combination 6 or 7. Both are good.\nLet's pick, for example, 6. (Note: You can indeed have more than one set of tests that achieve 100% MC/DC; all solutions are equally valid and good!)\n\nThe combinations that we need for 100% MC/DC coverage are {2, 3, 4, 6}.\nThese are only 4 combinations/tests we should focus.\nThis is a lot better than the 8 tests we needed for the path coverage.\n\n\nIndeed, in the example above, we saw that we need fewer tests when using MC/DC instead of path coverage.\n\n\n\n\nLoop boundary adequacy\nWhat to do when we have loops? After all, whenever there is a loop, the block inside of the loop might be executed many\ntimes; this would make testing more complicated.\nThink of a while(true) loop. It can go forever. If we wanted to be rigorous about it, we would have to test the program\nwhere the loop block is executed one time, two times, three times, ... Imagine a for(i = 0; i  loop with a break inside\nof the body. We would have to test what happens if the loop body executes one time, two times, three times, ..., up to ten times.\nIt might be impossible to exhaustively test all the combinations!\nWhat trade-off can we make? And, more especifically, for unbounded loops, where we do not really know how many times it will\nbe executed. We can define a loop boundary adequacy criteria:\nA test suite satisfies this criterion if and only if for every loop:\n\nA test case exercises the loop zero times\nA test case exercises the loop once\nA test case exercises the loop multiple times\n\nPragmatically speaking, the main challenge is devising tests where the loop is exercised multiple times. Devising tests that can \nindeed explore the space efficiently requires a good understanding of the program itself. Our tip is for you to make a little use of\nspecification-based techniques here. If you understand the specs, you might be able to devise good tests for the particular loop.\nrecord a video about the loop boundary adequacy\n\nCriteria subsumption\nYou might have noticed that, the more criteria we studied, the more \"rigorous\" they became. We started our discussion\nwith line coverage. Then we discussed branch coverage, and we noticed that we could generate more tests if we focused\non branchs. Then, we discussed branch + condition coverage, and we noticed that we could generate even more tests\nif we also focused on the conditions. And we kept doing that up to here.\nThere is indeed a relationship between all these criteria. Some strategies subsume other strategies.\nMore formally, a strategy X subsumes strategy Y if all elements that Y exercises are also exercised by X. You can see in \nthe figure below how the relationship among all the coverage criteria we studied.\nYou can see that, for example, branch coverage subsumes line coverage. This means that 100% of branch coverage always implies in 100% line coverage; however, 100% of line coverage does not imply in 100% branch coverage. 100% of branch + condition coverage imply in 100% branch coverage and 100% of line coverage.\n\nrecord a video about the criteria subsumption\n\nMore examples of Control-Flow Graphs\nWe can do Control-Flow Graphs for programs in any programming language. For example, see the piece of\nPython code below:\n# random_ads is a list of ads.\n# an ad contains three attributes:\n# * available: true/false indicating whether the ad \n#   is still available.\n# * reached: true/false indicating \n#   whether the number of paid prints was reached.\n# * prints: an integer indicating the \n#   number of times that the ad was printed.\ndef validate_ads(random_ads):\n01. valid_ads = []\n02. invalid_ads = []\n\n03. for random_ad in random_ads:\n04.   if random_ad.available and not random_ad.reached:\n05.     valid_ads.add(random_ad)\n06.   else:\n07.     invalid_ads.add(random_ad)\n\n08. for valid_ad in valid_ads:\n09.   valid_ad.prints += 1\n\n10. return valid_ads, invalid_ads\n\nA CFG for this piece of code would look like:\n\nStudy tip: Note how we modelled the for each loop.\nHow to use structural testing in practice\nAs a tester, you use the different coverage criteria to derive tests. If you decide that your goal is to achieve\nat least 80% branch + condition coverage, you derive tests until you reach it.\nIs there any advantage in using structural testing? We refer to two papers:\n\nHutchins et al.: \"Within the limited domain of our experiments, test sets achieving coverage levels over 90% usually showed significantly better fault detection than randomly chosen test sets of the same size. In addition, significant improvements in the effectiveness of coverage-based tests usually occurred as coverage increased from 90% to 100%. However, the results also indicate that 100% code coverage alone is not a reliable indicator of the effectiveness of a test set.\"\nNamin and Andrews: \"Our experiments indicate that coverage is sometimes correlated with effectiveness when size is controlled for, and that using both size and coverage yields a more accurate prediction of effectiveness than size alone. This in turn suggests that both size and coverage are important to test suite effectiveness.\"\n\nFor interested readers, a extensive literature review on the topic can be found in\nZhu, H., Hall, P. A., & May, J. H. (1997). Software unit test coverage and adequacy. ACM computing surveys (csur), 29(4), 366-427.\nExercises\nFor the first couple of exercises we use the following code:\npublic boolean remove(Object o) {\n01.  if (o == null) {\n02.    for (Node x = first; x != null; x = x.next) {\n03.      if (x.item == null) {\n04.        unlink(x);\n05.        return true;\n         }\n       }\n06.  } else {\n07.    for (Node x = first; x != null; x = x.next) {\n08.      if (o.equals(x.item)) {\n09.        unlink(x);\n10.        return true;\n         }\n       }\n     }\n11.  return false;\n}\n\nThis is the implementation of JDK8's LinkedList remove method.

A model gives us a structured way to understand\nhow the program operates (or should operate).\n\n\n\n\nDecision Tables\nDecision tables are used to model how a combination of conditions should lead to a certain action.\nThese tables are easy to understand and can be validated by the client that the software is created for.\nDevelopers can use the decision tables to derive tests that verify the correct implementation of the requirements with respect to the conditions.\nCreating decision tables\nA decision table is a table containing the conditions and the actions performed by the system based on these conditions. In this section, we'll discuss how to build them in first place.\nFor now the table contains all the combinations of conditions explicitly.\nLater we will look at ways to bring the amount of combinations present in the table down a bit.\nIn general a decision table looks like the following:\n\n  Variants\n  Conditions\n      TTFF\n  TFTF\n  Actionvalue1value2value3value4\n\n\nThe chosen conditions should always be independent from one another.\nIn this type of decision tables, the order of the conditions also do not matter, \ne.g., making  true and  false or making  false and after that  true, should result on the same outcome.\n(If the order does matter in some way, a state machine might be a better model.\nWe cover state machines later in this chapter.)\nWhen choosing a phone subscription, there are a couple of options you could choose.\nDepending on these options a price per month is given.\nWe consider the two options:\n\nInternational services\nAuto-renewal\n\nIn the decision table these will be turned into conditions.\nTrue then corresponds to a chosen option and false corresponds to a option that is not chosen.\nTaking international should increase the price per month.\nAuto-renewal decreases the price per month.\nThe decision tables is the following:\n\n  Variants\n  Conditions\n      InternationalFFTT\n  Auto-renewalTFTF\n  Actionprice/month10153032\n\n\nYou can see the different prices for the combinations of international and auto-renewal.\nDon't Care values: In some cases the value of a condition might not influence the action.\nThis is represented as a don't care value, often abbreviated to \"dc\".\nEssentially, \"dc\" is an combination of two columns.\nThese two columns have the same values for the other conditions and the same result.\nOnly the condition that had the dc value has different values in the expanded form.\n\n  Variants\n  Conditions\n      TdcF\n  dcTF\n  Actionvalue1value1value2\n\ncan be expanded to:\n\n  Variants\n  Conditions\n      TTTFF\n  TFTTF\n  Actionvalue1value1value1value1value2\n\nAfter expanding we can remove the duplicate columns.\nWe end up with the decision table below:\n\n  Variants\n  Conditions\n      TTFF\n  TFTF\n  Actionvalue1value1value1value2\n\n\nWe add another condition to the example above.\nA loyal costumer receives the same discount as a costumer who chooses the auto-renewal option. \nHowever, a costumer only gets the discount from one of the two.\nThe new decision table is below:\n\n  Variants\n  Conditions\n      InternationalFFFTTT\n  Auto-renewalTdcFTdcF\n  LoyaldcTFdcTF\n  Actionprice/month101015303032\n\nNote that when auto-renewal is true, the loyal condition does not change the outcome anymore and vice versa.\n\n\n\n*Default behavior*: Usually, NNN conditions lead to 2N2^N2​N​​ combinations or columns.\nOften, however, the number of columns that are specified in the decision table can be smaller.\nEven if we expand all the dc values.\n\nThis is done by using a default action.\nA default action means that if a combination of condition outcomes is not present in the decision table, the default action should be the result.\n\nIf we set the default charge rate to 10 per month the new decision table can be a bit smaller:\n\n  Variants\n  Conditions\n      InternationalFTTT\n  Auto-renewalFTdcF\n  LoyalFdcTF\n  Actionprice/month15303032\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting decision tables\nUsing the decision tables we can derive tests, such that we test whether the expected logic is implemented correctly.\nThere are multiple ways to derive tests for a decision table:\n\nAll explicit variants: Derive one test case for each column. The amount of tests is the amount of columns in the decision table.\nAll possible variants: Derive a test case for each possible combination of condition values. For NNN conditions this leads to 2N2^N2​N​​ test cases. Often, this approach is unrealistic because of the exponential relation between the number of conditions and the number of test cases.\nEvery unique outcome / All decisions: One test case for each unique outcome or action. The amount of tests depends on the actions in the decision table.\nEach condition T/F: Make sure that each conditions is true and false at least once in the test suite. This often results in two tests: All conditions true and all conditions false.\n\nMC/DC\nOne more way to derive test cases from a decision table is by using Modified Condition / Decision Coverage (MC/DC). \nThis is a combination of the last two ways of deriving tests shown above.\nWe have already discussed MC/DC in the Structural-Based Testing chapter.\nMC/DC has the two characteristics of All devisions and Each condition T/F with an additional characteristic that makes MC/DC special:\n\nEach condition is at least once true and once false in the test suite\nEach unique action should be tested at least once\nEach condition should individually determine the action or outcome\n\nThe third point is realized by making two test cases for each condition.\nIn these two test cases, the condition under test should have a different value, the outcome should be different, and the other conditions should have the same value in both test cases.\nThis way the condition that is under test individually influences the outcome, as the other conditions stay the same and therefore do not influence the outcome.\nBy choosing the test cases efficiently MC/DC needs less tests than all variants, while still exercising the important parts of the system.\nLess tests of course means less time taken to write the tests and a faster execution of the test suite.\nTo derive the tests we expand and rearrange the decision table of the previous example:\n\n  v1v2v3v4v5v6v7v8\n  Conditions\n      InternationalTTTTFFFF\n  Auto-renewalTTFFTTFF\n  LoyalTFTFTFTF\n  Actionprice/month3030303210101015\n\n\nFirst, we look at the first condition and we try to find pairs of combinations that would cover this condition according to MC/DC.\nWe look for combinations where only International and the price/month changes.\nThe possible pairs are: {v1, v5}, {v2, v6}, {v3, v7} and {v4, v8}.\nTesting both combinations of any of these pairs would give MC/DC for the first condition.\nMoving to Auto-renewal we find the pairs: {v2, v4}, {v6, v8}.\nFor this condition {v1, v3} and {v5, v7} are not viable pairs, because the action is the same among the two combinations.\nThe last condition, Loyal, gives the following pairs: {v3, v4}, {v7, v8}.\nBy choosing the test cases efficiently we should be able to achieve full MC/DC by choosing four of the combinations.\nWe want to cover all the actions in the test suite.\nTherefore we need at least v4 and v8.\nWith these decisions we have covered the International condition as well.\nNow we need one of v1, v2, v3 and one of v5, v6, v7.\nTo cover Loyal we add v7 and to cover Auto-renewal we add v2.\nNow we also cover all the possible actions.\nNow, for full MC/DC, we test the decisions: v2, v4, v7, v8.\n\n\n\n\nImplementing automated test cases for decision tables\nNow that we know how to derive the test cases from the decision tables, it is time to implement them as automated test cases.\nThe most obvious way to test the combinations is to create a single test for each of the conditions.\nWe continue with the example we created the decision table for earlier.\nTo start we write the tests for combinations v2 and v3.\nAssuming that we can use some implemented methods in a PhonePlan class the tests look like this:\n@Test\npublic void internationalAutoRenewalTest() {\n  PhonePlan plan = new PhonePlan();\n\n  plan.setInternational(true);\n  plan.setAutoRenewal(true);\n  plan.setLoyal(false);\n\n  assertEquals(30, plan.pricePerMonth());\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void internationalLoyalTest() {\n  PhonePlan plan = new PhonePlan();\n\n  plan.setInternational(true);\n  plan.setAutoRenewal(false);\n  plan.setLoyal(true);\n\n  assertEquals(30, plan.pricePerMonth());\n}\n\nAs you can see in the example above, the different tests for the different combinations are very similar.\nThe tests do the exact same thing, but just with different values.\nTo avoid the code duplication that comes with this approach to implementing decision table tests, we can use parameterized tests.\nParameterized Testing\nInstead of implementing a single test for each of the combinations, we want to implement a single test for all the combinations.\nThen for each combination we execute this test with the correct values.\nThis is done with a parameterized test.\nIn JUnit 5 this is done using the ParameterizedTest annotation.\nAdditionally, a Source is needed, which is given by another annotation.\nIn general this will look like the following:\n@ParameterizedTest\n@CsvSource({\n  \"true, 5, 8.0, ...\",  // test 1\n  \"false, 2, 0.6, ...\", // test 2\n  \"true, 1, 5.3, ...\",  // test 3\n  \"true, 3, 4.7, ...\"   // test 4\n})\npublic void someTest(boolean param1, int param2, double param3, ...) {\n  // Arrange\n  SomeObject some = new SomeObject();\n\n  // Act\n  double result = some.method(param1, param2);\n\n  // Assert\n  assertEquals(param3, result);\n}\n\nFor testing the combinations out of decision tables, usually the CsvSource is most convienient. Other sources can be found in the JUnit 5 docs. Each string in the CsvSource gives one test. Such a string consists of the arguments for the test function separated by commas. The first value is the first argument, the second value the second argument etc.\nWith the parameterized test we can easily create all tests we need for MC/DC of the decision table in the previous examples.\n@ParameterizedTest\n@CsvSource({\n  \"true, true, false, 30\",   // v2\n  \"true, false, true, 30\",   // v3\n  \"true, false, false, 32\",  // v4\n  \"false, false, false, 15\"  // v8\n})\npublic void pricePerMonthTest(boolean international, boolean autoRenewal,\n    boolean loyal, int price) {\n\n  PhonePlan plan = new PhonePlan();\n\n  plan.setInternational(international);\n  plan.setAutoRenewal(autoRenewal);\n  plan.setLoyal(loyal);\n\n  assertEquals(price, plan.pricePerMonth());\n}\n\nYou can see that the test is very similar as the tests in the previous example.\nInstead of directly using the values for one combination we use the parameters with the CsvSource to execute multiple tests.\n\n\n\nNon-binary choices and final guidelines\nWrite the video's accompanying text\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState Machines\nThe state machine is a model that describes the software system by describing its states.\nA system often has multiple states and various transitions between these states.\nThe state machine model uses these states and transitions to illustrate the system's behavior.\nThe main focus of a state machine is, as the name suggests, the states of a system.\nSo it is useful to think about what a state actually is.\nThe states in a state machine model describe where a program is in its execution.\nIf we need X to happen before we can do Y, we can use a state.\nX would then cause the transition to this state.\nFrom the state we can do Y, as we know that in this state X has already happened.\nWe can use as many states as we need to describe the system's behavior well.\nBesides states and transitions, a state machine has an initial state and events.\nThe initial state is the state that the system starts in.\nFrom that state the system can transition to other states.\nEach transition is paired with an event.\nThis event is usually one or two words that describe what has to happen to make the transition.\nOf course there are some agreements on how to make the models.\nThe notation we use is the Unified Modeling Language, UML.\nFor the state diagrams that means we use the following symbols:\n\nState: \nTransition: \nEvent: \nInitial state: \n\nFor the coming examples we model a (part of a) phone.\nWe start very simple with a state machines that models the phone's ability to be locked or unlocked.\nA phone that can be either locked or unlocked has two states: locked and unlocked.\nBefore all the face recognition and fingerprint sensors, you had to enter a password to unlock the phone.\nA correct password unlocks the phone and if an incorrect password is given the phone stays locked.\nFinally, an unlocked phone can be locked again by pushing the lock button.\nWe can use these events in the state machine.\n\nIn the diagram the initial state is LOCKED.\nUsually when someone starts using their phone, it is locked.\nTherefore the initial state of the state machine should also be LOCKED.\nSometimes an event can lead to multiple states, depending on a certain condition.\nTo model this in the state machines, we use conditional transitions.\nThese transitions are only performed if the event happens and if the condition is true.\nThe conditions often depend on a certain value used in the state machine.\nTo modify these values when a transition is taken in the state machine we use actions.\nActions are associated with a transition and are performed when the system uses that transition to go into another state.\nThe notation for conditions and actions is as follows:\n\nConditional transition: \nAction: \n\nWhen a user types the wrong password for four times in a row, the phone gets blocked.\nWe use n in the model to represent the amount of failed attempts.\nLet's look at the conditional transitions that we need to model this behavior first.\n\nWhen n (the number of failed unlock attempts) is smaller than 3, the phone stays in LOCKED state.\nHowever, when n is equal to 3, the phone goes to BLOCKED.\nHere we have an event, wrong password, than can lead to different states based on the condition.\nIn the previous state machine, n never changes.\nThis means that the phone will never go in its BLOCKED state, as that requires n to be equal to 3.\nWe can add actions to the state machine to make n change correctly.\n\nThe added actions are setting n to n+1 when an incorrect password is given and to 0 when a correct password is given.\nThis way the state machine will be in the BLOCKED state when a wrong password is given for four times in a row.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting state-machines\nLike with the decision tables, we want to use the state machine model to derive tests for our software system.\nFirst, we will have a look at what might be implemented incorrectly.\nAn obvious error that can be made is a transition going to the wrong state.\nThis will cause the system to act incorrectly so we want the tests to catch such errors.\nAdditionally, the conditions in conditional transitions and the actions in transition can be wrong.\nFinally, the behavior of a state should stay the same at all times.\nThis means that moving from and to a state should not change the behavior of that state.\nFor state machines we have a couple of test coverages.\nIn this chapter we go over three mainly used ways of defining test coverage:\n\nState coverage: each state has to be reached at least once\nTransition coverage: each transition has to be exercised at least once\nPaths: not exactly a way of describing test coverage, but we use paths to derive test cases\n\nTo achieve the state coverage we generally bring the system in a state through transitions and then assert that the system is in that state.\nTo test a single transition (for transition coverage) a bit more steps are needed:\n\nBring system in state that the transition goes out of\nAssert that the system is indeed in that state\nTrigger the transition's event.\nIf there is an action: check if this action has happened\nAssert that the system now is in the new state that the transition points to\n\nTo achieve full state coverage we need to arrive in each state once.\nFor the phone example we have three states so we can make three tests.\n\nCheck that the system is LOCKED when it is started\nGive the correct password and check that the system is UNLOCKED\nGive an incorrect password four times and check that the system is BLOCKED\n\nWith these three tests we achieve full state coverage, as the system is in each state at some point.\nWith the tests above, we have covered most of the transitions as well.\nThe only untested transition is the lock button from UNLOCKED to LOCKED.\nTo test this transition, we bring the system in UNLOCKED by giving the correct password.\nThen we trigger the lock button and assert that the system is in LOCKED.\nPaths and Transition trees\nBesides the individual transitions, we can also test the combinations of transitions.\nThese combinations of transitions are called paths.\nA logical thought might be: Let's test all the paths in the state machine!\nWhile this looks like a good objective, the number of paths will most likely be too high.\nTake a state machine that has a loop, i.e., a transition from state X to Y and a transition from state Y to X.\nWhen creating paths we can keep going back and forth these two states.\nThis leads to an infinite amount of paths.\nObviously, we cannot test all the paths. We will need to take a different approach.\nThe idea is that when using paths to derive test cases, we want each loop to be executed once.\nThis way we have a finite amount of paths to create test cases for.\nWe derive these tests by using a transition tree, which spans the graph of the state machine.\nSuch a transition tree is created as follows:\n\nThe root node is named as the initial state of the state machine\nFor each of the nodes at the lowest level of the transition tree:\nIf the state that the node corresponds to has not been covered before: \nFor each of the outgoing transitions of this node's state: \n Add a child node that has the name of the state the transition points to. If this state is already in the tree, add or increment a number after the state's name to keep the node unique\nIf any nodes were added: \nRepeat from step 2.\n\n\n\nThis is also demonstrated in the example below.\nTo make the transition table a bit more interesting we modify the phone's state machine to have an OFF state instead of a BLOCKED state.\nSee the state machine below:\n\nThe root node of the transition tree is the initial state of the state machine.\nWe append a number to make it easier to distinguish this node from other nodes of the same state.\n\nNow we for each outgoing transition from the OFF state we add a child node to OFF_0.\n\nOne node was added, so we continue by adding children to that node.\n\nNow, the only state we have not seen yet is UNLOCKED in the UNLOCKED_0 node.\nTherefore this is the only node we should add children to.\n\nNow all the states of the nodes in the lowest layer have been visited before so the transition tree is done.\nFrom a transition tree, we can derive tests.\nEach leaf node in the transition tree represents one path to test.\nThis path is given by going from the root node to this leaf node.\nIn the tests, we typically assert that we start in the correct state.\nThen, we trigger the next event that is needed for the given path and assert that we are in the next correct state.\nThese events that we need to trigger can be found in the state machine.\nThen this is done until the whole path is followed.\nIn the transition tree of the previous example there are four leaf nodes: OFF_1, OFF_2, LOCKED_1, LOCKED_2.\nWe want a test for each of these leaf nodes, that follows the path leading to that node.\nFor OFF_1 the test should 'move' the system from OFF to LOCKED and again to OFF.\nLooking at the state machine this gives the events home, long lock button.\nIn the test we would assert that the system is in OFF, then trigger home, assert that the system is in LOCKED, trigger long lock button and finally assert that the system is in OFF.\nThe tests for the other three paths can be derived in similar fashion.\nUsing the transition tree, each loop that is in the state machine is executed once.\nNow the amount of tests are manageable, while testing most of the important paths in the state machine.\n\n\n\n\nSneak paths and Transition tables\nIn the previous section, we discussed transition trees and how to use them to derive tests.\nThese tests check if the system behaves correctly when following different paths in the state machine.\nWith this way of testing, we check if the existing transitions in a state machine behave correctly.\nWe do not check if there exists any more transitions, transitions that should not be there.\nWe call these paths, \"sneak paths\".\nA sneak path is a path in the state machine that should not exist.\nSo, for example, we have state X and Y and the system should not be able to transition directly from X to Y.\nIf the system can in some way transition directly from X to Y, we have a sneak path.\nOf course, we want to test if such sneak paths exist in the system.\nTo this end we make use of transition tables.\nA transition table is a table containing each transition that is in the state machine.\nThe transition is given by the state it's going out of, the event that triggers the transition, and the state the transition goes to.\nA transition table typically looks somewhat like the following:\n\n  \n    STATES\n    Events\n  \n  \n    \n    event1\n    event2\n    event3\n  \n  \n    STATE1\n    STATE1\n    \n    STATE2\n  \n  \n    STATE2\n    \n    STATE1\n    \n  \n\n\nWe construct a transition table as follows:\n\nList all the state machine's states along the rows\nList all events along the columns\nFor each transition in the state machine note its destination state in the correct cell of the transition table.\n\nWe take a look at the same state machine we created a transition table for:\n\nTo make the transition table we list all the states and events in the table:\n\n  \n    STATES\n    Events\n  \n  \n    \n    home\n    wrong password\n    correct password\n    lock button\n    long lock button\n  \n  \n    OFF\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    LOCKED\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    UNLOCKED\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nThen we fill the table with the states that the transitions in the state machine point to:\n\n  \n    STATES\n    Events\n  \n  \n    \n    home\n    wrong password\n    correct password\n    lock button\n    long lock button\n  \n  \n    OFF\n    LOCKED\n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    LOCKED\n    \n    LOCKED\n    UNLOCKED\n    \n    OFF\n  \n  \n    UNLOCKED\n    \n    \n    \n    LOCKED\n    OFF\n  \n\n\nWe can see that there is, for example, a transition from UNLOCKED to LOCKED when the event lock button is triggered.\nNow that we have the transition table, we have to decide the intended behavior for the cells that are empty.\nThe default is to just ignore the event and stay in the same state.\nIn some cases one might want the system to throw an exception.\nThese decisions depend on the project and the customer's needs.\nAs discussed earlier, we can use the transition table to derive tests for sneak paths.\nUsually, we want the system to remain in its current state when we trigger an event that has an empty cell in the transition table.\nTo test for all possible sneak paths, we create a test case for each empty cell in the transition table.\nThis test will first bring the system to the state corresponding to the empty cell's row (you can use the transition table to find a suitable path), then triggers the event that corresponds to the empty cell's column, and finally the test asserts that the system is in the same state as before triggering the event.\nThe amount of 'sneak path tests' is the amount of empty cells in the transition table.\nWith these tests we can verify both existing and non-existing paths.\nThese techniques combined give a good testing suite from a state machine.\nSo far, we looked at rather simple and small state machines.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper states and regions\nWhen the modeled system becomes large and complex, typically so does the state machine.\nAt some point the state machine will consist of a lot of states and transitions, which makes it unclear and impractical to work with.\nTo resolve this issue and make a state machine more scalable we can use super states and regions.\nSuper states\nA super state is a state that consists of a state machine.\nBasically, we wrap a state machine in a super-state which we can then use as a state in another state machine.\nThe notation of the super-state is as follows: \n\nBecause the super state is, in essence, a state machine that can be used as a state, we know what should be inside of a super state.\nThe super state generally consists of multiple states and transitions, and it always has to have an initial state.\nAny transition going into the super state essentially goes to the initial state of the super state.\nA transition going out of the super state means that if the event on this transition is triggered in any of the super state's states, the system transitions into the state this transition points to.\nWith the super state we can choose to show it fully or we can collapse it.\nA collapsed super state is just a normal state in the state machine.\nThis state has the super state's name and the same incoming and outgoing transitions as the super state.\nWith the super states and the collapsing of super states we can modularize and combine state machines.\nThis allows us to shift the state machine's focus to different parts of the system's behavior.\nWe can use a super state even in the small example of a phone's state machine.\nThe two states LOCKED and UNLOCKED both represent the system in some sort of ON state.\nWe can use this to create a super state called ON.\n\nNow we can also simplify the state machine by collapsing the super state:\n\nRegions\nSo far we have had super states that contain one state machine.\nHere, the system is in only one state of the super state at once.\nIn some cases it may be useful to allow the system to be in multiple states at once.\nThis is done with regions.\nA super state can be split up into multiple regions.\nThese are orthogonal regions, meaning that the state machines in the regions are independent from each other; they do not influence the state machines in other regions.\nEach region contains one state machine.\nWhen the systems enters the super state, it enters all the initial states of the regions.\nThis means that the system is in multiple states at once.\nThe notation of regions is: \nExpanding regions is possible, but highly impractical and usually not wanted, because expanding the region requires creating a state for each combination of states in the different regions.\nThis causes the number of states and transitions to quickly explode.\nWe will not cover how to expand the regions because of this reason.\nIn general it is best to use small state machine and link these together using super states and regions.\nSo far when the phone was ON we modeled the LOCKED and UNLOCKED state.\nWhen the phone is on, it drains the battery.\nThe system keeps track of the level of the battery.\nLet's assume that our phone has two battery levels: low battery and normal battery.\nThe draining of the battery and the transitions between the states of this battery runs in parallel to the phone being locked or unlocked.\nWith parallel behavior like this, we can use the regions in our state machine model.\nthe state machine looks like the following, with the new battery states and the regions:\n\nYou can see that we assumed the battery to start in the normal level state.\nTherefore, when the system transitions to the ON state it will be in both LOCKED and NORMAL BATTERY states at once.\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementing state-based testing in practice\nYou know a lot about state machines as a model by now.\nOne thing we have not looked at yet is how these state machines are represented in the actual code.\nStates are very common in programming.\nMost classes in Object-Oriented-Programming each correspond to their own small state machine.\nIn these classes, we distinguish two types of methods: inspection and trigger methods.\nAn inspection method only provides information about an object's state.\nThis information consists of the values or fields of an object.\nThe inspection methods only provide information. They do not change the state (or values) of an object.\nTrigger methods bring the class into a new state.\nThis can be done by changing some of the class' values.\nThese trigger methods correspond to the events on the transitions in the state machine.\nIn a test, we want to bring the class to different states and assert that after each transition, the class is in the expected state.\nIn other words, a test scenario is basically a series of calls on the class's trigger methods.\nBetween these calls, we can call the inspection methods to check the state.\nAbstraction layer\nWhen a state machine corresponds to a single class, we can easily use the methods described above to test the state machine.\nHowever, sometimes the state machine spans over multiple classes.\nIn that case, you might not be able to easily identify the inspection and trigger methods.\nIn this scenario, the state machines can even correspond to end-to-end testing.\nHere, the flow of the entire system is under test, from input to output.\nThe system under test does not always provide a nice programing interface (API) to inspect the state or trigger the event for the transitions.\nA common example of such a system is a web application.\nIn the end, the web application works through a browser.\nTo access the state or to trigger the transitions you would then need to use a dedicated tool, like webdriver.\nUsing such a dedicated tool directly is not ideal, as you would have to specify each individual click on the web page to trigger events.\nWhat we actually need is an abstraction layer on top of the system under test.\nThis abstraction can just be a Java class, with the methods that we need to be able to test the system as its state machine.\nHence, the abstraction layer will contain the inspection method to check the state and the trigger methods to perform the transitions.\nWith this small abstraction layer, we can formulate the tests very clearly.\nTriggering a transition is just one method call and checking the state also requires only one method call.\nPage Objects\nCreating these abstraction layers is very common when testing web applications.\nIn this context, the abstractions are called Page Objects.\nAn example of a page object is shown in the diagram, made by Martin Fowler, below:\n\nAt the bottom, you can see a certain web page that we want to test.\nThe tool for communicating through the browser (webdriver for example), gives an API to access the HTML elements.\nAdditionally, the tool supports clicking on elements. For example, on a certain button.\nIf we use this API directly in the tests, the tests become unreadable very quickly.\nSo, we create a page object with just the methods that we need in the tests.\nThese methods correspond to the application, rather than the HTML elements.\nThe page objects implement these methods by using the API provided by the tool.\nThen, the tests use these methods instead of the ones about the HTML elements.\nBecause we are using methods that correspond to the application itself, they will be more readable than tests without the page objects.\nState Objects\nPage objects give us an abstraction for single pages or even fragments of pages.\nThis is already better than using the API for the HTML elements in the test, but we can take it a bit further.\nWe can make the page objects correspond to the states in the navigational state machine.\nA navigational state machine is a state machine that describes the flow through a web application.\nEach page will be a represented as a state.\nThe events of the transitions between these states show how the user can go from one to another page.\nWith this approach, the page objects each correspond to one of the states of the state machine.\nNow we do not call them page objects anymore, but state objects.\nIn these state objects we have the inspection and trigger methods.\nAdditionally, we have methods that can help with state self-checking.\nThese methods verify whether the state itself is working correctly, for example by checking if certain buttons can be clicked on the web page.\nNow the tests can be expressed in the application's context, using these three types of methods.\nBehavior-Driven Design\nThe state objects are mostly used for end-to-end testing in web development.\nAnother technique useful in end-to-end testing is behavior driven design.\nIn behavior driven design the system is designed with scenario's in mind.\nThese scenario's are written in natural language and describe the system's behavior in a certain situation.\nFor these scenarios to be used by tools, an example of a tool for scenario's is cucumber, we need to follow a certain format.\nThis is a standard format for scenario's, as it provides a very clear structure.\nA scenario consists of the following:\n\nTitle of the scenario\nGiven ...: Certain conditions that need to hold at the start of the scenario.\nWhen ...: The action taken.\nThen ...: The result at the end of the scenario.\n\nLet's look at a scenario for an ATM.\nIf we have a balance of $100, a valid card and enough money in the machine, we can give a certain amount of money requested by the user.\nTogether with the money, the card should be given back, and the balance of the account should be decreased.\nThis can be turned into the scenario 1 below:\nStory: Account Holder withdraws cash\n\nAs an Account Holder\nI want to withdraw cash from an ATM\nSo that I can get money when the bank is closed\n\nScenario 1: Account has sufficient funds\nGiven the account balance is $100\n And the card is valid\n And the machine contains enough money\nWhen the Account Holder requests $20\nThen the ATM should dispense $20\n And the account balance should be $80\n And the card should be returned\n\nThe small introduction above the scenario itself is part of the user story.\nA user story usually consists of multiple scenario's with respect to the user introduced.\nThis user is the account holder in this example.\nWith the general Given, When, Then structure we can describe a state transition as a scenario.\nIn general the scenario for a state transition looks like this:\nGiven I have arrived in some state\nWhen  I trigger a particular event\nThen  the application conducts an action\n And  the application moves to some other state.\n\nEach scenario will be able to cover only one transition.\nTo get an overview of the system as a whole we will still have to draw the entire state machine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther examples of real-world models\nSlack shared their internal flow chart that decides whether\nto send a notification of a message. Impressive, isn't it?\n\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nThe ColdHot air conditioning system has the following requirements:\n\nWhen the user turns it on, the machine is in an idle state.\nIf it's too hot, then, the cooling process starts. It goes back to idle when the defined temperature is reached.\nIf it's too cold, then, the heating process starts. It goes back to idle when the defined temperature is reached.\nIf the user turns it off, the machine is off. If the user turns it on again, the machine is back to idle.\n\nDraw a minimal state machine to represent these requirements.\nExercise 2.\nDerive the transition tree from the state machine of the assignment above.\nExercise 3.\nNow derive the transition table of the ColdHot state machine.\nHow many sneaky paths can we test based on the transition table?\nExercise 4.\nDraw the transition tree of the following state machine:\n\nUse sensible naming for the states in your transition tree.\nExercise 5.\nWith the transition tree you devised in the previous exercise and the state machine in that exercise.\nWhat is the transition coverage of a test that the following events: [order placed, order received, order fullfiled, order delivered]?\nExercise 6.\nDevise the decision table of the state machine that was given in the exercise above.\nIgnore the initial transition Order placed.\nExercise 7.\nHow many sneak paths are there in the state machine we used in the previous exercises?\nAgain ignoring the initial Order placed transition.\nExercise 8.\nConsider the following decision table:\n\n  CriteriaOptions\n  C1: Employed for 1 yearTFFTTT\n  C2: Achieved last year's goalTdcdcFTF\n  C3: Positive evaluation from peersTFTFFT\n  10%0%5%2%6%3%\n\n\nWhich decision do we have to test for full MC/DC?\nUse as few decisions as possible.\nExercise 9.\nSee the following generic state machine.\n\nDraw the transition tree of this state machine.\nExercise 10.\nThe advertisement (ad) feature is an important source of income for the company. Because of that, the life cycle of an ad needs to be better modelled. \nOur product team defined the following rules:\n\nThe life cycle of an ad starts with an 'empty' ad being created.\nThe company provides information about the ad. More specifically, the company defines an image, a description, and how many times it should appear. When all these information is set, the ad then needs to wait for approval.\nAn administrator checks the content of the ad. If it follows all the rules, the ad then waits for payment. If the ad contains anything illegal, it then goes back to the very beginning.\nAs soon as the company makes the payment, the ad becomes available to users.\nWhen the number of visualizations is reached, the ad is then considered done. At this moment, the company might consider running the campaign again, which moves the ad to wait for payment again. The company might also decide to simply end the campaign at that moment, which puts the ad in a finalized state.  \nWhile appearing for the users, if more than 10\\% of the users complain about the ad, the ad is then marked as blocked. Cute Babies then gets in contact with the company. After understanding the case, the ad either starts to appear again for the users, or gets marked as innapropriate. An innapropriate ad will never be shown again to the users.\n\nDevise a state diagram that describes the life cycle of an ad.\nExercise 11.\nA microwave oven has the following requirements:\n\nIts initial state is OFF.\nWhen the user turns it on, the machine goes to an ON state.\nIf the user selects warms meal, then, the WARMING process starts. It goes back to ON when the defined time is reached. A user may cancel it at any time, taking the microwave back to the ON state.\nIf the user selects defrost meal, then, the DEFROSTING process starts. It goes back to ON when the defined time is reached. A user may cancel it at any time, taking the microwave back to the ON state.\nThe user can turn off the microwave (after which it is OFF), but only if the microwave is not warming up or defrosting food.\n\nDraw a minimal state machine to represent the requirements. For this question do not make use of super (OR) states.\nAlso, remember that, if a transition is not specified in the requirements, it simply does not exist, and thus, should not be represented in the state machine.\nExercise 12.\nDevise a state transition tree for the microwave state machine.\nExercise 13.\nAgain consider the state machine requirements for the microwave.\nThere appears to be some redundancy in the defrosting and warming up functionality, which potentially can be described using super states (also called OR-states).\nWhich effect does this have on the total number of states and transitions for the resulting diagram with a super state?\n\nThere will be one extra state, and two less transitions.\nThere will be one state less, and the same number of transitions.\nThe total number of states will remain the same, and there will be two less transitions.\nThis has no effect on the total number of states and transitions.\n\nExercise 14.\nSee the requirement below:\nStefan works for Foodgram, a piece of software that enables users to send pictures of the dishes they prepare themselves. Foodgram's upload system has specific rules:\n\n* The software should only accept images in JPG format.\n* The software should not accept images that are bigger than 20MB.\n* The software accepts images in both high and low resolution.\n\nAs soon as a user uploads a photo, the aforementioned rules are applied. \nThe software then either says *\"Congratulations! Your picture was uploaded successfully\"*, or *\"Ooops, something went wrong!\"*\" (without any specific details about why it happened).\nCreate a decision table that takes the three conditions and their respective outcomes into account. \nNote: conditions should be modeled as boolean decisions.\nExercise 15\nTwitter is a software system that enables users to share short messages within their friends. \nTwitter's revenue model is ultimately based on advertisements (\"ads\").\nTwitter's system needs to decide when to serve ads to its users, and which ones. For a given user a given ad can be highly-relevant, and the system seeks to serve the most relevant ads as often as possible without scaring users away.\nTo that end, assume that the system employs the following rules to decide whether a user U gets served an ad A at the moment user U opens their Twitter app:\n\nIf the user U has not been active during the past two weeks, she will not get to see add A;\nIf the user U has already been served an ad during her last hour of activity, she will not get to see ad A;\nFurthermore, if the user U has over 1000 followers (an influencer), she will only get to see ad A if A is labeled as highly-relevant for U. Otherwise, user U will see A even if it is not highly-relevant.\n\nWe can model this procedure in a decision table, in various ways.\nThe complete table would have four conditions and 16 variants. We will try to create a more compact decision table. Note: We will use Boolean conditions only.\nOne way is to focus on the positive cases only, i.e., specify only the variants in which ad A is being served to user U. If you don't use 'DC' (don't care) values, how will the decision table look like?\nReferences\n\nChapter 4 of the Foundations of software testing: ISTQB certification.

Let's take a step back first.\nThe way we tested systems so far was by creating separate classes for the tests.\nThe production code and test code were completely separated.\nThe test suite (consisting of the test classes) exercises and then observes the system under test to check whether it is acting correctly.\nIf the system does something that is not expected by the test suite, the test suite fails.\nThe code in the test suite is completely redundant.\nIt does not add any behavior to the system.\nWith self-testing, we \"move\" a bit of the test suite into the system itself.\nThese assertions we insert into production code allows the system to check if it is running correctly by itself.\nWe do not have to run the test suite, but instead the system can check (part of) its behavior during the normal execution of the system.\nLike with the test suite, if anything is not acting as expected, an error will be thrown.\nIn software testing the self-tests are used as an additional check in the system additional to the test suite.\nAssertions\nThe simplest form of this self-testing is the assertion.\nAn assertion is a boolean expression at a specific point in a program\nwhich will be true unless there is a bug in the program.\nIn other words,\nan assertion basically says that a certain condition has to be true \nat the time the assertion is executed.\nIn Java, to make an assertion we use the assert keyword:\nassert  : \"\";\n\nThe assert keywords checks if the  is true.\nIf it is, nothing happens.\nThe program just continues its execution as everything is according to plan.\nHowever, if the  yields false, the assert throws an AssertionError.\nWe have implemented a class representing a stack, we just show the pop method:\npublic class MyStack {\n  public Element pop() {\n    assert count() > 0 : \" The stack does not have any elements to pop.\"\n\n    // ... actual method body ...\n\n    assert count() == oldCount - 1;\n  }\n}\n\nIn this method, we check if a condition holds at the start: the stack should have at least one element.\nThen, after the actual method we check whether the count is now one lower than before popping.\nThese conditions are also known as pre- and postconditions.\nWe cover these in the following section.\nNote: The assertion's message is optional, but can be very helpful \nfor debugging.\nAlways include a message that describes what is going wrong if the assertion is failing.\nIn Java, asserts can be enabled or disabled.\nIf the asserts are disabled, they will never throw an AssertionError even if their conditions are false.\nJava's default configuration is to disable the assertions.\nTo enable the asserts we have to run Java with a special argument in one of these two ways: java -enableassertions or java -ea.\nWhen using Maven or IntelliJ, the assertions are enabled automatically when running tests.\nWith Eclipse or Gradle, we have to enable it ourselves.\nWhen running the system with assertions enabled, \nwe increase the fault sensitivity of the system, i.e., the system\nbecomes more sensible to faults.\nThis might seem undesirable, but when executing tests, \nwe want the tests to fail.\nAfter all, if a test fail, we just found another fault in the system that we can then fix before deploying it to final users.\n\n\n\n\nNote how assertions play the role of test oracles here, but in a slightly\ndifferent way. Just to remember, oracles inform us\nwhether the software behaved correctly.\nSo far, we only used \"value comparison\" as oracle. Given an input that\nwe devised, we knew what output to expect. For example, in a program that\nreturns the square root of a number, given n=4, the value we expect as output\nis 2.\nInstead of focusing on a specific instances, like we did so far, property checks, like the ones we are going to see in the remaining of this chapter, are more general rules (properties) that we assert on our code. For example, a program that, given nnn, returns n2n^2n​2​​, has a property that it should never return a negative number.\nAssertions also serve as an extra safety measure.\nIf it is crucial that a system runs correctly, we can use the asserts to add some additional testing during the system's execution.\nHowever, we note that assertions do not replace unit tests.\nAssertions are often of a more general nature.\nWe still need the specific cases in the unit tests. A combination of\nboth is what we desire.\n\n\n\n\nPre- and Postconditions\nWe briefly mentioned pre- and postcondition in an example.\nNow it is time to formalize the idea and see how to create good pre- and postconditions and their influence on the code that we are writing.\nTony Hoare pioneered reasoning about programs with assertions.\nHe proposed the now so-called Hoare Triples.\nA Hoare Triple consists of a set of preconditions {P}\\{ P \\}{P}, a program AAA and a set of postconditions {Q}\\{ Q \\}{Q}\nWe can express the Hoare Triple as follows: {P} A {Q}\\{ P \\}\\ A\\ \\{ Q \\}{P} A {Q}.\nThis can be read as: if we know that PPP holds, and we execute AAA, then, we end up in a state where QQQ holds.\nIf there are no preconditions, i.e., no assumptions needed for the execution of AAA, we can simply set PPP to true.\nIn a Hoare Triple, the AAA can be a single statement or a whole program.\nWe look at AAA as a method.\nThen PPP and QQQ are the pre- and postcondition of the method AAA respectively.\nNow we can write the Hoare Triple as: {preconditions} method {postconditions}\\{ preconditions \\}\\ method\\ \\{ postconditions \\}{preconditions} method {postconditions}.\nPreconditions\nWhen writing a method, each condition that needs to hold for the method to successfully execute can be a pre-condition.\nThese pre-conditions can be turned into assertions.\nSuppose a class that keeps track of our favorite books.\nLet's define some pre-conditions for the merge method.\nThe method adds the given books to the list of favorite books and then sends some notification to, e.g., a phone.\npublic class FavoriteBooks {\n  List favorites;\n\n  // ...\n\n  public void merge(List books) {\n    favorites.addAll(books);\n    pushNotification.booksAdded(books);\n  }\n}\n\nWhen creating pre-conditions, we have to think about what needs to hold to let the method execute.\nWe can focus on the parameter books first.\nThis cannot be null, because then the addAll method will throw a NullPointerException.\nIt should also not be empty, because then we cannot add any books.\nFinally, adding books that we already have does not make sense, so the books should not all be present in the favorites already.\nNow we can take a look at the favorites.\nThis also cannot be null because then we cannot call addAll on favorites.\nThis gives us 4 pre-conditions and, thus, 4 assertions in the method:\npublic class FavoriteBooks {\n  // ...\n\n  public void merge(List books) {\n    assert books != null;\n    assert favorites != null;\n    assert !books.isEmpty();\n    assert !favorites.containsAll(books);\n\n    favorites.addAll(books);\n    pushNotification.booksAdded(books);\n  }\n}\n\nWeakening preconditions\nThe amount of assumptions made before a method can be executed (and, with that, the amount of pre-conditions) is a design choice.\nOne might want to weaken the pre-conditions, so that the method accepts/is able to handle more situations.\nTo that aim, we can remove a pre-condition as the method itself can handle the situation where the pre-condition would be false.\nThis makes the method more generally applicable, but is also increases its complexity.\nThe method always has to check some extra things to handle the cases that could had been pre-conditions.\nFinding the balance between the amount of preconditions and complexity of the method is part of designing the system.\nWe can remove some of the pre-conditions of the merge method by adding some if-statements to the method.\nFirst, we can try to remove the !books.isEmpty() assertions.\nThis means that the method merge has to handle empty books lists itself.\npublic class FavoriteBooks {\n  // ...\n\n  public void merge(List books) {\n    assert books != null;\n    assert favorites != null;\n    assert !favorites.containsAll(books);\n\n    if (!books.isEmpty()) {\n      favorites.addAll(books);\n      pushNotification.booksAdded(books);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nBy generalizing the merge method, we have removed one of the pre-conditions.\nWe can even remove the !favorites.containsAll(books) assertion by adding some more functionality to the method.\npublic class FavoriteBooks {\n  // ...\n\n  public void merge(List books) {\n    assert books != null;\n    assert favorites != null;\n\n    List newBooks = books.removeAll(favorites);\n\n    if (!newBooks.isEmpty()) {\n      favorites.addAll(newBooks);\n      pushNotification.booksAdded(newBooks);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNote that, although we increased the complexity of method by removing some of its pre-conditions and dealing with these cases in the implementation, the method now is also easier to be called by clients. After all, the method has less pre-conditions to be called.\nPost-conditions\nThe pre-conditions of a method hold when the method is called. At the end of the method, its post-conditions should hold.\nIn other words, the post-conditions formalize the effects that a method guarantees to have when it is done with its execution.\nThe merge method of the previous examples does two things.\nIt adds the new books to the favorites list.\nLet's turn this into a boolean expression, so we can formulate this as a post-condition.\npublic class FavoriteBooks {\n  // ...\n\n  public void merge(List books) {\n    assert books != null;\n    assert favorites != null;\n\n    List newBooks = books.removeAll(favorites);\n\n    if (!newBooks.isEmpty()) {\n      favorites.addAll(newBooks);\n      pushNotification.booksAdded(newBooks);\n    }\n\n    assert favorites.containsAll(books);\n  }\n}\n\nThe other effect of the method is the notification that is sent.\nUnfortunately, we cannot easily formalize it as a post-condition.\nIn a test suite, we would probably mock the pushNotification and then use Mockito.verify to verify that booksAdded was called.\nIt is important to realise that these post-conditions only have to hold if the preconditions held when the method was called. In other words, if the method's pre-conditions were not fully satisfied, the method might not guarantee its post-conditions.\nYou also saw in the example that we could not really write assertions for\nsome of post-conditions of the method. \nPost-conditions (and pre-conditions for that matter) might not cover all the possible effects; however,\nhopefully they do cover a relevant subset of the possible behavior.\nPost-conditions of complex methods\nFor complex methods, the post-conditions also become more complex.\nThat's actually another reason for keeping the method simple.\nIf a method has multiple return statements, it is good to think if these are actually needed.\nMaybe it is possible to combine them to one return statement with a general post-condition.\nOtherwise, the post-condition essentially becomes a disjunction of propositions.\nEach return statement forms a possible post-condition (proposition) and the method guarantees that one of these post-conditions is met.\nWe have a method body that has three conditions and three different return statements.\nThis also gives us three post-conditions.\nThe placing of these post-conditions now becomes quite important, so the whole method is becoming rather complex with the postconditions.\nif (A) {\n  // ...\n  if (B) {\n    // ...\n    assert PC1;\n    return ...;\n  } else {\n    // ...\n    assert PC2;\n    return ...;\n  }\n}\n// ...\nassert PC3;\nreturn ...;\n\nNow if A and B are true, post-condition 1 should hold.\nIf A is true and B is false, postcondition 2 should hold.\nFinally, if A is false, postcondition 3 should hold.\nHow weak pre-conditions affect the post-conditions?\nBased on what we saw about pre- and post-conditions, we can come up with a few\nrules:\n\nThe weaker your pre-condition, the more situations your method\nis able to handle, and the less thinking your client needs to do.\nHowever, with weak pre-conditions, the method will always have to do\nthe checking.\n\nThe post-conditions are only guaranteed if the pre-conditions held; if not,\nthe outcome can any anything. With weak pre-conditions, the method might have\nto handle different situations, leading to multiple post-conditions guarded\nby conditions over the inputs or the program state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvariants\nWe have seen that preconditions should hold before a method's execution and postconditions should hold after a method's execution.\nNow we move to conditions that always have to hold, before and after a method's execution.\nThese conditions are called invariants.\nAn invariant is thus a condition that holds throughout the entire lifetime of a system, an object, or a data structure.\nIn terms of implementation, a simple way of using invariants is by creating a \"checker\" method.\nThis method will go through the data structure/object/system and will assert whether the invariants hold.\nIf an invariant does not hold, it will then throw an AssertionError.\nFor simpler invariants, it is common to see a boolean method that checks the invariants of the structure/object/system.\nSuppose we have a binary tree datastructure.\nAn invariant for this data structure would be that when a parent points to a child, then the child should point to this parent.\nWe can make a method that checks if this representation is correct in the given binary tree.\npublic void checkRep(BinaryTree tree) {\n  BinaryTree left = tree.getLeft();\n  BinaryTree right = tree.getRight();\n\n  assert (left == null || left.getParent() == tree) &&\n      (right == null || right.getParent() == tree)\n\n  if (left != null) {\n    checkRep(left);\n  }\n  if (right != null) {\n    checkRep(right);\n  }\n}\n\nIn checkRep(), we first check if the children nodes of the current node are pointing to this node as parent.\nThen, we continue by checking the child nodes the same way we checked the current node.\nClass invariants\nIn Object-Oriented Programming, these checks can also be applied at the class-level.\nThis gives us class invariants.\nA class invariant ensures that its conditions will be true throughout the entire lifetime of the object.\nThe first time a class invariant should be true is right after its construction (i.e., when the constructor method is done).\nThe class invariant should also hold after each public method invocation.\nMoreover, methods can assume that, when they start, the class invariant holds.\nA private method invoked by a public method can leave the object with the class invariant being false.\nHowever, the public method that invoked the private method should then fix this and end with the class invariant again being true.\nThis is all formalized by Bertrand Meyer as: \"The class variant indicates that a proposition P can be a class invariant if it holds after construction, and before and after any call to a public method assuming that the public methods are called with their preconditions being true.\"\nOf course, we want to know how to implement these class invariants.\nTo implement simple class invariant in Java, we can use the boolean method that checks if the representation is okay.\nWe usually call this method invariant.\nWe then assert the return value of this method after the constructor, and before and after each public method.\nIn these public methods, the only pre-conditions and post-conditions that have to hold additionally are the ones that are not in the invariant.\nWhen handling more complicated invariants, we can split the invariant into more methods.\nThen we use these methods in the invariant method.\nWe return to the FavoriteBooks with the merge method.\nWe had a pre-condition saying that favorites != null.\nGiven that this should always be true, we can turn it into a class variant.\nAdditionally, we can add the condition that pushNotification != null.\npublic class FavoriteBooks {\n  List favorites;\n  Listener pushNotification;\n\n  public FavoriteBooks(...) {\n    favorites = ...;\n    pushNotification = ...;\n\n    // ...\n\n    assert invariant();\n  }\n\n  protected boolean invariant() {\n    return favorites != null && pushNotification != null;\n  }\n\n  public void merge(List books) {\n    assert invariant();\n\n    // Remaining preconditions\n    assert books != null;\n\n    List newBooks = books.removeAll(favorites);\n\n    if (!newBooks.isEmpty()) {\n      favorites.addAll(newBooks);\n      pushNotification.booksAdded(newBooks);\n    }\n\n    // Remaining postconditions\n    assert favorites.containsAll(books);\n\n    assert invariant();\n  }\n\n}\n\nNote that the invariant method checks the two conditions.\nWe call invariant before and after merge and we only assert the pre- and post-conditions that are not covered in the invariant method.\nWe also assert the result of the invariant method at the end of the constructor.\n\n\n\n\nDesign by Contracts\nSuppose a client system and a server system. The client makes use of the API\nof of the server. \nThe client and server are bound by a contract.\nThe server does its job as long as its methods are used properly by the client.\nThis relates strongly to the pre- and post-conditions that we discussed earlier.\nThe client has to use the server's methods in a way that their preconditions hold.\nThe server then guarantees that the post-conditions will hold after the method call, i.e., makes sure the method delivers what it promises.\nNote how the pre- and post-conditions of the server forms a contract\nbetween the server and the client.\nDesigning a system following such contracts is called what\nwe call Design by Contracts.\nIn such design, contracts are represented by interfaces.\nThese interfaces are used by the client and implemented by the server.\nThe following UML diagram illustrates it:\n\nSubcontracting\nImagine now an interface. This interface has its own pre- and post-conditions.\nNow, what happens to these conditions when we create another implementation of this interface (i.e., a class that implements the interface, or a class that extends some base class)?\nIn the UML diagram above, we see that the implementation can have different pre-, post-conditions, and invariants than its base interface.\nIn terms of pre-conditions, the new implementation must be able to work with the pre-conditions that were specified in the interface.\nAfter all, the interface is the only thing the client sees of the system.\nThe implementation cannot add any pre-conditions to the server's preconditions.\nIn terms of strength, we now know that P′P'P​′​​ has to be weaker than (or as weak as) PPP.\nThe postcondition work the other way around.\nThe implementation must do at least the same work as the interface, but it is allowed to do a bit more.\nTherefore, Q′Q'Q​′​​ should be stronger than (or as strong as) QQQ.\nFinally, the interface guarantees that the invariant always holds.\nThen, the implementation should also guarentee that at least the interface's invariant holds.\nSo, I′I'I​′​​ should be stronger than (or as strong as) III.\nIn short, using the notation of the UML diagram:\n\nP′P'P​′​​ weaker than PPP\nQ′Q'Q​′​​ stronger than QQQ\nI′I'I​′​​ stronger than III\n\nThe subcontract (the implementation) requires no more and ensures no less than the actual contract (the interface).\n\n\n\n\nLiskov Substitution Principle\nThe subcontracting follows the general notion of behavioral subtyping, proposed by Barbara Liskov.\nThe behavioral subtyping states that if we have a class T and this class has some sub-classes,\nthe clients or users of class T should be able to choose any of T's sub-classes.\nThis notion of behavioral subtyping is now known as the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP).\nIn other words, the LSP states that if you use a class, you should be able to replace this class by one of its subclasses.\nThe sub-contracting we discussed earlier is just a formalization of this principle.\nProper class hierarchies follow the Liskov Substitution Principle.\nLeep the LSP in mind when designing and implementating a software system.\nHow can we test that our classes follow the LSP?\nTo test the LSP, we have to make some test cases for the public methods of the super class and execute these tests with all its subclasses.\nWe could just create the same tests to each of the subclasses' test suites.\nThis, however, leads to a lot of code duplication in the test code, which we would like to avoid.\nIn Java, the List interface is implemented by various sub-classes.\nTwo examples are the ArrayList and LinkedList.\nCreating the tests for each of the sub-classes separately will result in the following structure.\n\nThe ArrayList and LinkedList will behave the same for the methods defined in List.\nTherefore, there will be duplicate tests for these methods.\nTo avoid this code duplication we can create a test suite just for the super class.\nThis test suite tests just the public methods of the super class.\nThe tests in this test suite should then be executed for each \nof the sub-classes of the super class.\nThis can be done by making the test classes extend the \"super test class\".\nThe \"sub test class\" will have all the common tests defined in the \"super test class\" and its own specific tests.\nThis is how the test suite looks like:\n\nHere, the ArrayListTest and LinkedListTest extend the ListTest.\nList is an interface, so the ListTest should be abstract.\nWe cannot instantiate a List itself, so we should not be able to execute the ListTest without a test class corresponding to one of List's subclasses.\nListTest contains all the common tests of ArrayListTest and LinkedListTest.\nArrayListTest and LinkedListTest can contain their specific tests.\nIn the example, you can see that the hierarchy of the test classes is similar to the hierarchy of the classes they test.\nTherefore, we say that we use a parallel class hierarchy in our test classes.\nNow we have one problem.\nHow do we make sure that the \"super test class\" executes its tests in the correct subclass?\nThis depends on the test class that is executed and the subclass it is testing.\nIf we have class T, with subclasses A and B, then when executing tests for A we need the test class of T to use an instance of A; when executing tests for B, we need the test class of T to use an instance of B.\nOne way to achieve this behavior is by using the Factory Method design pattern,\nwhich works as follows:\nIn the test class for the interface level (the \"super test class\"), we define an abstract method that returns an instance with the interface type.\nBy making the method abstract, we force the test classes of the concrete implementations to override it.\nWe return the instance of the specific subclass in the overriden method.\nThis instance is then used to execute the tests.\nWe want to use the Factory Method design pattern in our tests for the List.\nWe start by the interface level test class.\nHere, we define the abstract method that gives us a List.\npublic abstract class ListTest {\n\n  private List list;\n\n  protected abstract List createList();\n\n  @BeforeEach\n  public void setUp() {\n    list = createList();\n  }\n\n  // Common List tests using list\n}\n\nThen, for this example, we create a class to test the ArrayList.\nWe have to override the createList method and we can define any tests specific for the ArrayList.\npublic class ArrayListTest extends ListTest {\n\n  @Override\n  protected List createList() {\n    return new ArrayList();\n  }\n\n  // Tests specific for the ArrayList\n}\n\nNow, the ArrayListTest inherits all the ListTest's tests, so these will be executed when we execute the ArrayListTest test suite.\nBecause the createList() method returns an ArrayList, the common test classes will use an ArrayList.\n\n\n\n\nProperty-Based Testing\nWe briefly mentioned property checks.\nThere, we used the properties in assertions.\nWe can also use the properties for test case generation instead of just assertions.\nGiven that these properties should always hold, we can test them with any input that we like.\nWe typically make use of a generator to try a high number of different inputs,\nwithout the need of writing them all ourselves.\nThese generators often create a series of random input values for a test function.\nThe test function then checks if the property holds using an assertion.\nFor each of the generated input values, this assertion is checked. If we find an input value that makes the assertion to fail, we can affirm that the property does not hold.\nThe first implementation of this idea was called QuickCheck and was originally developed for Haskell.\nNowadays, most languages have an implementation of QuickCheck, including Java.\nThe Java implementation we are going to use is made by Paul Holser and is available on his github.\nAll implementations of QuickCheck follow the same idea, but we will focus on the Java implementation.\nHow does it work?\n\nFirst, we define properties.\nSimilar to defining test methods, we use an annotation on a method with an assertion to define a property: @Property.\nQuickCheck includes a number of generators for various types.\nFor example, Strings, Integers, Lists, Dates, etc.\nTo generate values, we can simply add some parameters to the annotated method.\nThe arguments for these parameters will then be automatically generated by QuickCheck.\nNote that the existing generators are often not enough when we want to test one\nof our own classes; in these cases, we can create a custom generator which generates random values for this class.\n\nQuickcheck handles the amount of generated inputs. After all, generating random values for the test input is tricky:\nthe generator might create too much data to efficiently handle while testing.\n\nFinally, as soon as QuickCheck finds a value that breaks the property, it\nstarts the shrinking process.\nUsing random input values can result in very large inputs.\nFor example lists that are very long or strings with a lot of characters.\nThese inputs can be very hard to debug. Smaller inputs are preferrable when it comes to testing.\nWhen an input makes the property fail, QuickCheck tries to find shrink this input while it still makes the property fail.\nThat way it gets the small part of the larger input that actually causes the problem.\n\n\nAs an example:\na property of Strings is that if we add two strings together, the length of the result should be the same as the sum of the lengths of the two strings summed.\nWe can use property-based testing and the QuickCheck's implementation to make tests for this property.\n@Runwith(JUnitQuickcheck.class)\npublic class PropertyTest {\n\n  @Property\n  public void concatenationLength(String s1, String s2) {\n    assertEquals(s1.length() + s2.length(), (s1 + s2).length())\n  }\n}\n\nconcatenationLength had the Property anotation, so QuickCheck will generate random values for s1 and s2 and execute the test with those values.\nProperty-based testing changes the way we automate our tests.\nUsually, we just automate the execution of the tests.\nWith property-based testing, by means of QuickCheck's implementation, we also automatically generate the inputs of the tests.\nProperty-based testing and AI\nA lot of today's research goes into a AI for software testing is about generating good input values for the tests.\nWe try to apply artificial intelligence to find inputs that exercise an important parts of the system.\nWhile the research's results are very promising, there still exist difficulties with this test approach.\nThe main problem is that if the AI generates random inputs, how do we know for sure that the outcome is correct, i.e., how do we know that the problem behaved correctly for that random value?\nWith the unit test we made so far we manually took certain inputs, thought about the correct outcome, and made the assertion to expect that outcome.\nWhen generating random inputs, we cannot think about the outcome every time.\nThe pre- and postconditions, contracts, and properties we discussed in this chapter can help us solve the problem.\nBy well-defining the system in these terms, we can use them as oracles in the test cases.\nThe properties always have to be true, so we can use them in all the randomly generated test cases.\nWe will discuss more about AI techniques in a future chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nSee the code below:\npublic Square squareAt(int x, int y) {\n  assert x >= 0;\n  assert x = 0;\n  assert y \nWhat assertion(s), if any, can be turned into a class invariant?\nExercise 2.\nConsider the piece of code in the previous example.\nSuppose we remove the last assertion (line 10), which states that the result can never be null.\nAre the existing preconditions of the squareAt method enough to ensure the property in the original line 10?\nWhat can we add to the class (other than the just removed postcondition) to guarentee this property?\nExercise 3.\nYour colleague works on a drawing application.\nHe has created a Rectangle class.\nFor rectangles, the width and height can be different from each other, but can't be negative numbers.\nYour colleague also defines the Square class.\nSquares are a special type of rectangle: the width and height should be equal and also can't be negative.\nYour colleague decides to implement this by making Square inherit from Rectangle.\nThe code for the two classes is the following.\nclass Rectangle {\n  protected int width;\n  protected int height;\n\n  protected boolean invariant() { return width > 0 && height > 0; }\n\n  public Rectangle(int width, int height) {\n    assert width > 0;\n    assert height > 0;\n    this.width = width;\n    this.height = height;\n    assert invariant()\n  }\n\n  public int area() {\n    assert invariant();\n    int a = width * height;\n    assert a > 0;\n    return a;\n  }\n\n  public void resetSize(int width, int height) {\n    assert width > 0;\n    assert height > 0;\n    this.width = width;\n    this.height = height;\n    assert invariant();\n  }\n}\n\nclass Square extends Rectangle {\n  public Square(int x) {\n    assert x > 0;\n    super(x, x);\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public void resetSize(int width, int height) {\n    assert width == height;\n    assert width > 0;\n    super.resetSize(width, height);\n  }\n}\n\nInspired by Bertrand Meyer's design by contracts, he also use asserts to make sure contracts are followed. He explicitly defines preconditions and postconditions in various methods of the base Rectangle class and the derived Square class.\nA second colleague comes in and expresses concerns about the design.\nHow can you use the assertions provided to discuss the correctness of this design?\nIs the second colleagues concern justified?\nWhat principle is violated, if any?\nExplain with the assertions shown in the code.\nExercise 4.\nYou run your application with assertion checking enabled. \nUnfortunately, it reports an assertion failure signaling a class invariant violation in one of the libraries your application makes use of.\nAssume that the contract of the library in question is correct, and that all relevant preconditions are encoded in assertions as well.\nCan you fix this problem? \nIf so, how? \nIf not, why?\nExercise 5.\nHTTP requests return a status code which can have several values. As explained on Wikipedia:\n\nA 4xx status code \"is intended for situations in which the error seems to have been caused by the client\". \nA well known example is the 404 (Page not found) status code.\nA 5xx status code \"indicates cases in which the server is aware that it has encountered an error or is otherwise incapable of performing the request.\"\nA well known example is the 500 (Internal Server Error) status code.\n\nWhat is the best correspondence between these status codes and pre- and postconditions?\nExercise 6.\nA method M belongs to a class C and has a precondition P and a postcondition Q. \nNow, suppose that a developer creates a class C' that extends C, and \ncreates a method M' that overrides M. \nWhich one of the following statements correctly explains the relative\nstrength of the pre (P') and postconditions (Q') of the overridden method M'?\n\nP' should be equal or weaker than P, and Q' should be equal or stronger than Q.\nP' should be equal or stronger than P, and Q' should be equal or stronger than Q.\nP' should be equal or weaker than P, and Q' should be equal or weaker than Q.\nP' should be equal or stronger than P, and Q' should be equal or weaker than Q.\n\nExercise 7.\nWhich of the following is a valid reason to use assertions in your code?\n\nTo verify expressions with side effects.\nTo handle exceptional cases in the program.\nTo conduct user input validation.\nTo make debugging easier.\n\nReferences\n\nC2 Wiki, What are assertions? http://wiki.c2.com/?WhatAreAssertions\n\nMitchell, R., McKim, J., & Meyer, B.

More specifically, \nspecification-based, structural-based, and model-based techniques.\nHowever, most of requirements we tested via specification-based techniques had a single responsibility. Most of the source code\nwe tested via structural-based techniques fit in a single unit/class.\nA large software system, however, is composed of many of those units/responsibilities. Together, they compose\nthe complex behavior of our software system. In this chapter, we are going to discuss \nthe different test levels (i.e., unit, integration, and system), their advantages and disadvantages.\nUnit testing\nIn some situatins, our goal is indeed to test a single feature of the software, \"purposefully ignoring the other units of the systems\".\nLike we have been done so far. When we test units in isolation, we are doing what we call unit testing.\nDefining what a 'unit' is, is challenging and highly dependent on the context.\nA unit can be just one method, or can consist of multiple classes.\nAccording to Roy Osherove's unit testing definition:\n\"A unit test is an automated piece of code that invokes a unit of work in the system.\nAnd a unit of work can span a single method, a whole class or multiple classes working together to achieve one single logical purpose that can be verified.\"\nAs with any testing strategy, unit testing has advantages and disadvantages:\n\nFirstly, one advantage of unit tests is its speed of execution.\nA unit test usually takes just a couple of milliseconds to execute.\nFast tests give us the ability to test huge portions of the system in a small amount of time.\nSecondly, unit tests are easy to control.\nWe have a high degree of control on how the unit tests exercise the system.\nA unit test tests the software by giving certain parameters to a method and then comparing the return value of a method to the expected result.\nThe parameters and expected result values are very easy to be adapted/modified in the test.\nFinally, unit tests are easy to write.\nThe JUnit test framework is a very nice and easy framework to write unit tests in.\nIt does not require a lot of setup or additional work to write the tests.\n\nOf course, unit testing also has some disadvantages:\n\nOne of which is the reality of the unit tests.\nA software system is rarely composed of a single class or fulfills a single logical purpose.\nThe large amount of classes in a system and the interaction between these classes can make the system behave differently in its real application than in the unit tests.\nHence, the unit test do not perfectly represent the real execution of a software system.\nAnother disadvantage that follows from this is that some bugs simply cannot be caught by means of unit tests. They happen only in the integration of the different components (which we are not exercising in a pure unit test).\n\nSystem testing\nUnit tests indeed do not exercise the system in a realistic way.\nTo get a more realistic view of the software, we should run it in its entirely. All the components, databases, front end, etc,\nrunning together. And then devise tests. \nWhen do it, we are doing what we call system testing.\nIn practice, instead of testing small parts of the system in isolation, system tests execute the system as a whole.\nNote that we can also call system testing as black-box testing, because the system is some sort of black box to the tests.\nWe do not care or actually know what goes on inside of the system (the black box) as long as we get the expected output for a given input.\nWhat are the advantages of system testing?\nThe obvious advantage of system testing is how realistic the test are.\nThe system executes as if it is being used in a normal setting.\nThis is good. After all,\nthe more realistic the tests are, the higher the chance of it actually working will be.\nThe system tests also capture the user's perspective more than unit tests do.\nFaults that the system tests find, can then be fixed before the users would notice the failures that are caused by these faults.\nHowever, system testing also has its downsides.\nSystem tests are often slow when compared to unit tests.\nHaving to start and run the whole system, with all its components, takes time.\nSystem tests are also harder to write.\nSome of the components, e.g., databases, require complex setup before they can be used in a testing scenario.\nThis takes additional code that is needed just for automating the tests.\nLastly, system tests tend to become flaky.\nFlaky tests mean that the tests might pass one time, but fail the other time.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegration testing\nUnit and system testing are the two extremes of test levels.\nUnit tests focus on the smallest parts of the system, while system tests focus on the whole system at once.\nHowever, sometimes we want something in between.\nIntegration testing offers such a level between unit and system testing.\nLet's look at a real example.\nWhen a system has an external component, e.g., a database, developers often create a class whose only responsibility is to interact \nwith this external component.\nNow, instead of testing all the system's components, we just want test this class and its interaction with the component it is made for.\nOne class, one (often external) component. This is integration testing.\nIn integration testing, we test multiple components of a system, but not the whole system altogether.\nThe tests focus on the interaction between these few components of the system.\nThe advantage of this approach is that, while not fully isolated, devising tests just for a specific integration \nis easier than devising tests for all the components together. Because of that, the effort of writing such tests\nis a bit higher than when compared to unit tests (and lower when compared to system tests). \nSetting up the external component, e.g., the database, to the \nstate the tester wants, requires effort. \nCan we fully replace system testing with integration testing? After all, it is more real than unit tests and less expensive\nthan system tests. Well... No. Some bugs are really tricky and might only happen in specific sitations where multiple\ncomponents are working together. There is no silver bullet.\n\n\n\n\nThe Testing Pyramid\nWe discussed three levels of tests: unit, system, and integration. How much should we do of each?\nA famous diagram that help us in discussion is the so-called testing pyramid.\n\nThe diagram indicates all the test levels we discussed, plus manual testing. The more you go to the top, the more\nreal the test is; however, the more complex it is to devise it.\nHow much should we do of each then? The common practice in industry is also represented in the diagram. The size of the pyramid slice represents the the amount of test we would want of each test level. \nUnit test is at the bottom of the pyramid, which means that we want most tests to be unit tests.\nThe reasons for this have been discussed in the unit testing section (they are fast and require less effort to be written).\nThen, we go for integration tests, of which we do a bit less than unit tests. Given the extra effort that integration tests require,\nwe make sure to write tests for the integrations we indeed need.\nLastly, we perform a bit less system tests, and even less manual tests.\nAgain, note that the further up the pyramid, the closer to reality (and more complex) the tests become.\nThese are important factors in determining what kind of tests to create for a given software system.\nWe will now go over a couple of guidelines you can use to determine what level of tests to write when testing a system (which you should take with a grain of salt; after all, software systems are different from each other, and might require specific guidelines):\n\nWe start at the unit level.\nWhen you have implemented a clear algorithm that you want to test, unit tests are the way to go.\nIn an algorithmic piece of code, the parameters are easily controllable, so with unit test you can test the different cases your algorithm might encounter.\n\nThen, whenever the system is interacting with an external component, e.g. a database or a web service, integration testing is the way to go.\nFor each of the external components that the system uses, integration tests should be created to test the interaction between the system and the external component.\n\nSystem tests are very costly, so often we do not test the entire system with it.\nHowever, the absolutely critical parts of the system (the ones that should never, ever, stop working), system tests are fundamental.\n\nAs the testing pyramid shows, the manual tests are not done a lot compared to the other testing levels.\nThe main reason is that manual testing is expensive.\nManual testing is mainly used for exploratory testing. In practice, exploratory testing helps testers in finding issues that could not be found any other way.\n\n\nSomething you should definitely try to avoid is the so-called ice cream cone.\nThe cone is the testing pyramid, but put upside down.\n\nIt is common to see teams mostly relying on manual tests. Whenever they have system tests, it is not because they believe on the power\nof system tests, but because the system was so badly designed, that unit and integration tests are just impossible to be automated.\nWe will discuss design for testability in future chapters.\n\n\n\n\nAn academic remark on the testing pyramid\nto be written\n\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nNow we have a skeleton for the testing pyramid.\nWhat words/sentences should be at the numbers?\n\n(Try to answer the question without scrolling up!)\nExercise 2.\nAs a tester, you have to decide which test level (i.e., unit, integration, or system test) you will apply.\nWhich of the following statements is true?\n\nIntegration tests, although more complicated (in terms of automation) than unit tests, would better help in finding bugs in the communication with the webservice and/or the communication with the database.\nGiven that unit tests could be easily written (by using mocks) and they would cover as much as integration tests would, it is the best choice in this problem.\nThe most effective way to find bugs in this code is through system tests. In this case, the tester should run the entire system and exercise the batch process. Given that this code can be easily mocked, system tests would also be cheap.\nWhile all the test levels can be used for this problem, testers would likely find more bugs if they choose one level and explore all the possibilities and corner cases there.\n\nExercise 3.\nThe tester should now write an integration test for the OrderDao class below.\npublic class OrderDeliveryBatch {\n\n  public void runBatch() {\n\n    OrderDao dao = new OrderDao();\n    DeliveryStartProcess delivery = new DeliveryStartProcess();\n\n    List orders = dao.paidButNotDelivered();\n\n    for(Order order : orders) {\n      delivery.start(order);\n\n      if(order.isInternational()) {\n        order.setDeliveryDate(\"5 days from now\");\n      } else {\n        order.setDeliveryDate(\"2 days from now\");\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass OrderDao {\n  // accesses a database\n}\n\nclass DeliveryStartProcess {\n  // communicates with a third-party webservice\n}\n\nWhich one of the following statements is not required when writing\nan integration test for this class?\n\nReset the database state before each test.\nApply the correct schema to the database under test.\nAssert that any database constraints are met.\nSet the transaction autocommit to true.\n\nExercise 4.\nA newly developed product started off with some basic unit tests but later on decided to only add integration tests and system tests for the new code that was written. This was because a user interacts with the system as a whole and therefore these types of tests were considered more valuable. Thus, unit tests became less prevalent, whereby integration tests and system tests became a more crucial part of the test suite. This transition can be described as:\n\nTransitioning from a testing pyramid to an ice-cream cone pattern\nTransitioning from an ice-cream cone anti-pattern to a testing pyramid\nTransitioning form an ice-cream cone pattern to a testing pyramid\nTransitioning from a testing pyramid to an ice-cream cone anti-pattern\n\nExercise 5.\nTU Delft just built an in-house software to control the payroll of its employees. The applications makes use of Java web technologies and stores data in a Postgres database. Clearly, the application frequently retrieves, modifies, and inserts large amounts of data into the database. All this communication is made by Java classes that send (complex) SQL queries to the database. \nAs testers, we know that a bug can be anywhere, including in the SQL queries themselves.

How can we do it? We can simulate the external component!\nFor that, we will use mock objects.\nWhen we mock an object, we create a simulation of this object.\nTo handle external dependencies, we mock (simulate) the class in the system that interacts with the dependency.\nInstead of doing the actual work of the external components, mock objects just return fake, hard-coded results.\nThese return values can be configured inside of the test itself. We will see how it works in practice soon.\nThe use of mock objects has some advantages.\nReturning these pre-configured values is way faster than accessing an external component.\nSimulating objects also gives us a lot more control.\nIf we, for example, want to make sure the system keeps going even if one of its dependencies crashes, we can just tell the simulation to crash; think of how hard would it be to crash a database just to test if your system reacts to that well (although techniques such as chaos monkey have become really popular!).\nMock objects are therefore widely used in software testing, mainly to increase testability.\nAs we have discussed, external systems that the system under test relies on are often mocked to increase controllability and observability. We often mock:\n\nExternal components that might be hard to control, or to slow to be used in a unit test, such as databases and webservices.\nTo simulate exceptions that are hard to trigger in the actual system.\nTo control the behavior of complex third party libraries.\nTo test how the different components interact (i.e., exchange messages) among each other.\n\nImplementation-wise, we follow some steps:\n\nWe create a mock object.\nOnce it has been created, we give it to the class that normally uses the concrete implementation of the mocked object.\nThis class is now using the mocked object while the tests are executed.\nAt first, the mock does not know how to do anything.\nSo, before running the tests, we have to tell it exactly what to do when a certain method is called.\nWe trigger the action on the class/method under test. During its execution, note that the mock replaces the external component.\nWe make assertions on the mock object, often related to its execution.\n\nMockito\nIn Java the most used framework for mocking is Mockito (mockito.org).\nTo perform the steps we mentioned above, we use a couple of methods provided by Mockito:\n\nmock(): creates a mock object of the given class. The class can be retrieved from any class by .class.\nwhen(.).thenReturn(): defines the behavior when the given method is called on the mock. In this case  will be returned.\nverify().: asserts that the mock object was exercised in the expected way.\n\nMuch more functionalities are described in Mockito's documentation.\nSuppose we have a method that filters invoices.\nThese invoices are saved in a database and retrieved from the database by this function.\nThe invoices are filtered on their price.\nAll those above 100 are filtered.\npublic class InvoiceFilter {\n\n    public List filter() {\n\n        InvoiceDao invoiceDao = new InvoiceDao();\n        List allInvoices = invoiceDao.all();\n\n        List filtered = new ArrayList<>();\n\n        for(Invoice inv : allInvoices) {\n            if(inv.getValue() \nWithout mocks, the test would need to insert some testing invoices in the database first:\n@Test\npublic void filterInvoicesTest() {\n  InvoiceDao dao = new InvoiceDao();\n  Invoice i1 = new Invoice(\"M\", 20.0);\n  Invoice i2 = new Invoice(\"A\", 300.0);\n  dao.save(i1);\n  dao.save(i2);\n\n  InvoiceFilter f = new InvoiceFilter(dao);\n  List result = f.filter();\n\n  assertEquals(1, result.size());\n  assertEquals(i1, results.get(0));\n  dao.close();\n}\n\nAnd of course, clear the database afterwards. Otherwise the test will break in the second run, as there will be two invoices stored in the database! (The database stores data permanenty; so far, we never had to 'clean' the objects; after all, they were always stored in-memory only.)\n\n\n\n\nNow instead of using the database, we want to replace it with a mock object.\nThis way our test will be faster and we can more easily control what the Database-Access-Object returns.\nFor that to happen, we first need to make sure we can inject the InvoiceDao\nto the InvoiceFilter class. Instead of instantiating it, we'll change the InvoiceFilter class to actually receive InvoiceDao via constructor. \npublic class InvoiceFilter {\n\n    private InvoiceDao dao;\n\n    public InvoiceFilter (InvoiceDao dao) {\n        this.dao = dao;\n    }\n\n    public List filter() {\n\n        List allInvoices = dao.all();\n\n        List filtered = new ArrayList<>();\n\n        for(Invoice inv : allInvoices) {\n            if(inv.getValue() \nNow, we can mock the InvoiceDao class and pass the mocked instance\nto the InvoiceFilter:\n@Test\npublic void filterInvoicesTest() {\n  InvoiceDao dao = mock(InvoiceDao.class);\n  Invoice i1 = new Invoice(\"M\", 20.0);\n  Invoice i2 = new Invoice(\"A\", 300.0);\n\n  List list = Arrays.asList(i1, i2);\n  when(dao.all()).thenReturn(list);\n\n  InvoiceFilter f = new InvoiceFilter(dao);\n  List result = f.filter();\n\n  assertEquals(1, result.size());\n  assertEquals(i1, results.get(0));\n}\n\nNote how we now have full control over the InvoiceDao class.\nThe InvoiceFilter uses the all() method of the InvoiceDao to get the invoices.\nWith the mock, we can easily give the two invoices that we want to test on (note how\nwe are passing i1 and i2.\nNote also how we do not have to keep a database running while executing the tests!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about Mockito\nAdd one more example with Mockito here, using the verify(), and spy()\n\nDealing with static methods\nDiscuss how to add an abstraction on top of a static method, so that testing becomes easier.\n\nDealing with APIs you don't control\nDiscuss how to add an abstraction on top of things you don't control, e.g., Clock.\n\nMocking in practice: when to mock?\nDiscuss here when to mock\n\nMocks are a useful tool when it comes to write real isolated unit tests.\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nSee the following class:\npublic class OrderDeliveryBatch {\n\n  public void runBatch() {\n\n    OrderDao dao = new OrderDao();\n    DeliveryStartProcess delivery = new DeliveryStartProcess();\n\n    List orders = dao.paidButNotDelivered();\n\n    for (Order order : orders) {\n      delivery.start(order);\n\n      if (order.isInternational()) {\n        order.setDeliveryDate(\"5 days from now\");\n      } else {\n        order.setDeliveryDate(\"2 days from now\");\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass OrderDao {\n  // accesses a database\n}\n\nclass DeliveryStartProcess {\n  // communicates with a third-party webservice\n}\n\nWhich of the following Mockito lines would never appear in a test for the OrderDeliveryBatch class?\n\nOrderDao dao = Mockito.mock(OrderDao.class);\nMockito.verify(delivery).start(order); (assume order is an instance of Order)\nMockito.when(dao.paidButNotDelivered()).thenReturn(list); (assume dao is an instance of OrderDao and list is an instance of List)\nOrderDeliveryBatch batch = Mockito.mock(OrderDeliveryBatch.class);\n\nExercise 2.\nYou are testing a system that triggers advanced events based on complex combinations of Boolean external conditions relating to the weather (outside temperature, amount of rain, wind, ...). \nThe system has been cleanly designed and consists of a set of cooperating classes that each have a single responsibility.\nYou create a decision table for this logic, and decide to test it using mocks. Which is a valid test strategy?\n\nYou use mocks to support observing the external conditions.\nYou create mock objects to represent each variant you need to test.\nYou use mocks to control the external conditions and to observe the event being triggered.\nYou use mocks to control the triggered events.\n\nExercise 3.\nBelow, we show the InvoiceFilter class. This class is responsible for returning all the invoices that have an amount smaller than 100.0. It makes use of the InvoiceDAO class, which is responsible for the communication with the database.\npublic class InvoiceFilter {\n\n    private InvoiceDao invoiceDao;\n\n    public InvoiceFilter(InvoiceDao invoiceDao) {\n        this.invoiceDao = invoiceDao;\n    }\n\n    public List filter() {\n        List filtered = new ArrayList<>();\n        List allInvoices = invoiceDao.all();\n\n        for(Invoice inv : allInvoices) {\n            if(inv.getValue() \nWhich of the following statements is false about this class?\n\nIntegration tests would help us achieve a 100% branch coverage, which is not possible solely via unit tests.\nIts implementation allows for dependency injection, which enables mocking.\nIt is possible to write completely isolated unit tests for it by, e.g., using mocks.\nThe InvoiceDao class (a direct dependency of the InvoiceFilter) itself should be tested by means of integration tests.\n\nExercise 4.\nClass A depends on a static method in another class B.\nSuppose you want to test class A, which approach(es) can you take to be able to test properly?\n\nMock class B to control the behavior of the methods in class B.\nRefactor class A, so the outcome of the method of class B is now used as an parameter.\n\nOnly approach 1.\n\nNeither.\nOnly approach 2.\nBoth.\n\nReferences\n\nFowler, Martin.

Note how we had to refactor the code for that happen.  We have to design our code in a way that it makes it easy to test the code!\nTestability is related to the easeness of writing automated tests to that\ncode.\nWe know that automated tests are crucial in software development; therefore, it is essential that our code is testable.\nIn this chapter, we'll discuss some design practices that increases\nthe testability of our software systems.\n\n\n\n\nDependency Injection\nDependency injection is a design choice we can use to make our code more testable.\nWe will illustrate what dependency injection is it by means of an analogy:\nSay we need a hammer to perform a certain task.\nWhen we are asked to do this task, we could go search and find the hammer.\nThen, once we have the hammer, we can use it to perform the task.\nHowever, another approach is to say that we need a hammer when someone asks us to perform the task.\nThis way, instead of getting the hammer ourselves, we get it from the person that wants us to do the task.\nWe can do the same when managing the dependencies in our code.\nInstead of the class instantiating dependency itself, the class asks for the dependency (via constructor or a setter, for example).\nWe actually applied this idea in the Mocking chapter already. But let's revisit it:\nIn the Mockito example, it was easy to make the InvoiveFilter use the mock.\nLet's assume that the InvoiveFilter is implemented as follows:\npublic class InvoiceFilter {\n\n  public void filter() {\n    InvoiceDao dao = new InvoiceDao();\n\n    // ...\n  }\n\n}\n\nIn other words, the InvoiceFilter itself instantiates the InvoiceDao. \nIn this implementation, there is no way to pass the mock to the InvoiceFilter. Any test code we write will necessarily use a concrete InvoiceDao. \nAs we cannot control the way the InvoiceDao operates, this makes it a lot harder to write automated tests.\nOur tests\nwill need a working database to run!\nInstead, we can design our class in a way that it allows dependencies\nto be injected. Note how we receive the dependency via constructor now:\npublic class InvoiceFilter {\n\n  private InvoiceDao invoiceDao;\n\n  public InvoiceFilter(InvoiceDao invoiceDao) {\n    this.invoiceDao = invoiceDao;\n  }\n\n  public void filter() {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nNow we can instantiate the InvoiceFilter and pass it a InvoiceDao mock in the test code. This InvoiceFilter also enables the production code to pass a concrete InvoiceDao when the program is run normally (after all, we want it to access the real database in production!).\nThis simple change in the design of the class makes the creation of\nautomated tests easier and, therefore, increases the testability of the code.\nThe dependency injection principle improves our code in many ways:\n\nEnables us to mock the dependencies in the test code.\nMakes all the dependencies more explicit; after all, they all need to\nbe injected (via constructor, for example).\nThe class becomes more extensible. As a client of the class, you can pass any dependency via the constructor. Suppose a class depends on a type A (and receives it via constructor). As a client, you can pass A or any implementation of A, e.g., if A is List, you can pass ArrayList or LinkedList. Your class now can work with many different implementations of A. (You should read more about the Open/Closed Principle).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPorts and Adapters\nThe way a software system is designed influences how easy it is to test the system.\nAs we discussed before, the idea of designing a system in a way that it is testable is called design for testability.\nIt is important that a software developer knows about certain ways to design for testability in order to implement systems well.\nIn general, design for testability comes down to separating the domain and the infrastructure of the systems.\nThe domain is the core of the system: The business rules, its logic, its entities, etc.\nThis is very specific to the system that is being built.\nA system also commonly makes use of a database, or webservices, or any other external components.\nWe consider them as infrastructure. In our software systems,\nwe often have classes which the role is to make a bridge between the external component and the core of our sytem.\nTo increase testability, we need to separate these two layers (core/domain and infrastructure) as much as possible.\nIn practice, we observe that when domain code and infrastructure code are mixed up together, the system just gets harder to test.\nTo separate the domain and the infrastructure, we can use the idea of Ports and Adapters, as named by Alistair Cockburn.\nPorts & Adapters is also called the Hexagonal Architecture.\nFollowing this idea, the domain (business logic) depends on \"Ports\" rather than directly on the infrastructure.\nThese ports are just interfaces that define what the infrastructure is able to do.\nThese ports are completely separated from the implementation of the infrastructure.\nThe \"adapters\", on the other hand, are very close to the infrastructure. \nThese are the implementations of the ports that talk to the database or webservice etc. They know how the infrastructure works and how to communicate with it.\nIn the schema below, you can see that the ports are therefore part of the domain.\n\nPorts and Adapters helps us a lot with the testability of our code.\nAfter all, if our core domain depends only on ports, we can easily mock them!\nTo sum up, make sure your domain/core code does not depend on the infrastructure\ndirectly. Create a layer that abstracts the infrastructure away! This layer can then be easily mocked.\nNote: The idea of separating the domain and the infrastructure is also intensively\ndiscussed in the Domain-Driven Design book (which we recommend you to read!).\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign for testability tips\nWe end this chapter with a couple of practical tips that you can use to create a well designed, testable software system.\n\nCohesion: Cohesive classes are classes that do only one thing. Cohesive classes tend to be easier to test. If one of your classes is not cohesive, you can split the class into multiple small cohesive classes. This way you can test each separate class more easily.\n\nCoupling: Coupling represents the amount of classes that a class depends on. A highly coupled class needs a lot of other classes to work. Coupling hurts testability. Imagine having to create ten mocks, define the behavior of these ten mocks just one class. Reducing coupling is tricky and maybe one of the biggest challenges in software design. To reduce coupling, you can, for example, group some of the dependencies together and/or create bigger abstractions.\n\nComplex Conditions: When conditions are very complex (i.e., are composed of multiple boolean operations), maybe it is better split them into multiple conditions. Testing these simpler conditions is easier than testing one very complex condition.\n\nPrivate methods: A common question is whether to test private methods or not. The answer is usually \"no\". In principle, we would like to test the private methods only through the public methods that use them. This means that we test if the public method behaves correctly, not the private method. If you feel like you want to test the private method in isolation (because it might be a very large important method), this might mean that the method should probably have its own separate class, which can be tested in isolation. \n\nStatic metods: Static methods can hurt testability, as we cannot control the behavior of the static methods (i.e., they are hard to mock). Therefore, we avoid using static methods whenever possible.\n\nLayers: When using other's code or external dependencies, creating layers/classes that abstract away the dependency might help you in increasing testability. Do not be afraid to create these extra layers (although they do add complexity). \n\nInfrastructure: Again, make sure not to mix the infrastructure with the domain. You can use the methods we discussed above.\n\nEncapsulation: Encapsulation is about bringing the behavior of a class close to the data. Encapsulation will help you identify the problems in the code easier.\n\n\nNote how there is a deep synergy between well design production code and testability!\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nHow can we improve the testability of the OrderDeliveryBatch class?\npublic class OrderDeliveryBatch {\n\n  public void runBatch() {\n\n    OrderDao dao = new OrderDao();\n    DeliveryStartProcess delivery = new DeliveryStartProcess();\n\n    List orders = dao.paidButNotDelivered();\n\n    for (Order order : orders) {\n      delivery.start(order);\n\n      if (order.isInternational()) {\n        order.setDeliveryDate(\"5 days from now\");\n      } else {\n        order.setDeliveryDate(\"2 days from now\");\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass OrderDao {\n  // accesses a database\n}\n\nclass DeliveryStartProcess {\n  // communicates with a third-party webservice\n}\n\nWhat techniques can we apply? What would the new implementation look like? Think about what you would need to do to test the OrderDeliveryBatch class.\nExercise 2.\nConsider the following requirement and implementation.\nA webshop gives a discount of 15% whenever it's King's Day.\n\npublic class KingsDayDiscount {\n\n  public double discount(double value) {\n\n    Calendar today = Calendar.getInstance();\n\n    boolean isKingsDay = today.get(MONTH) == Calendar.APRIL\n        && today.get(DAY_OF_MONTH) == 27;\n\n    return isKingsDay ? value * 0.15 : 0;\n\n  }\n}\n\nWe want to create a unit test for this class.\nWhy does this class have bad testability?\nWhat can we do to improve the testability?\nI.e. what makes it very hard to test the method?\nExercise 3.\nSarah just joined a mobile app team that has been trying to write automated tests for a while.\nThe team wants to write unit tests for some part of their code, but \"that's really hard\", according to the developers.\nAfter some code review, the developers themselves listed the following\nproblems in their codebase:\n\nMay classes mix infrastructure and business rules\nThe database has large tables and no indexes\nUse of static methods\nSome classes have too many attributes/fields\n\nTo increase the testability, the team has budget to work on two out of the four issues above.\nWhich items should Sarah recommend them to tackle first?\nNote: All of the four issues should obviously be fixed.\nHowever, try to prioritize the two most important onces: Which influence the testability the most?\nExercise 4.\nObservability and controllability are two important concepts when it comes to software testing.\nThe three developers below could benefit from improving either the observability or the controllability of the system/class under test.\n\n\"I can't really assert that the method under test worked well.\"\n\"I need to make sure this class starts with that boolean set to false, but I simply can't do it.\"\n\"I just instantiated the mock object, but there's simply no way to inject it in the class.\"\n\nFor each of the problems above: is it related to observability or controllability?\nReferences\n\nCockburn, Alistair.

We discuss more about Test-Driven Design later.\n\nWriting tests first gives faster feedback on the code that we are writing.\nInstead of writing a lot of code and then a lot of tests, i.e. getting a lot of feedback at once after a long period of time, we create a test and then write a small piece of code for that test.\nNow we get feedback after each test that we write, which is usually after a piece of code that is much smaller than the pieces of code we test at once in the traditional approach.\nWhenever we have a problem it will be easier to identify it, as the added code is smaller.\nMoreover if we do not like anything it is easier to improve the code.\n\nWe already talked about the importance of controllability when creating automated tests.\nBy thinking about the tests before implementing the code we automatically make sure that the code is easy to control.\nThis improves the code quality as it will be easier to test the controllable code.\n\nFinally, the tests that we write can indicate some problems in the code.\nToo many tests for just one class can indicate that the class has too many functionalities and that it should be split up into more classes.\nIf we need too many mocks inside of the tests the class might be too coupled, i.e. it needs too many other classes to function.\nIf it is very complex to set everything up for the test, we may have to think about the pre-conditions that the class uses.\nMaybe there are too many or maybe some are not necessary.\n\n\nGiven all these advantages, should we use TDD 100% of time?\nThere is, of course, no universal answer. While some research shows the advantages of TDD, others are more in doubt about it.\nMissing a video about the advantages of TDD here\n\nTest-Driven Design\nWill I create a better class design if I use Test-Driven Development? Well, yes and no; TDD doesn't do magic. In the following, we discuss the effects of the practice, and how the practice can help developers during class design.\nDevelopers commonly argue that TDD helps software design, improving internal code quality. For example, Kent Beck [1], Robert Martin [2], Steve Freeman [3], and Dave Astels [4], state in their books (without scientific evidence) that the writing of unit tests in a TDD fashion promotes significant improvement in class design, helping developers to create simpler, more cohesive, and less coupled classes. They even consider TDD as a class design technique [5], [6]. Nevertheless, the way in which TDD actually guides developers during class design is not yet clear.\nAfter interviewing some developers, we observed the following.\nTDD does not drive to a better design by itself\nParticipants affirmed that the practice of TDD did not change their class design during the experiment. The main justification was that their experience and previous knowledge regarding object-orientation and design principles guided them during class design. They also affirmed that a developer with no knowledge in object-oriented design would not create a good class design just by practicing TDD or writing unit tests.\nThe participants gave two good examples reinforcing the point. One of them said that he made use of a design pattern he learned a few days before. Another participant mentioned that his studies on SOLID principles helped him during the exercises.\nThe only participant who had never practiced TDD before stated that he did not feel any improvement in the class design when practicing the technique. Curiously, this participant said that he considered TDD a design technique. It somehow indicates that the popularity of the effects of TDD in class design is high. That opinion was slightly different from that of experienced participants, who affirmed that TDD was not only about design, but also about testing.\nHowever, different from the idea that TDD and unit tests do not guide developers directly to a good class design, all participants said that TDD has positive effects on class design. Many of them mentioned the difficulty of trying to stop using TDD or thinking about tests, what can be one reason for not having significant difference in terms of design quality in the code produced with and without TDD.\n\"When you are about to implement something, you end up thinking about the tests that you’ll do. It is hard to think \"write code without thinking about tests!\". As soon as you get used to it, you just don’t know another way to write code...\"\nAccording to them, TDD can help during class design process, but in order to achieve that, the developer should have certain experience in software development. Most participants affirmed that their class designs were based on their experiences and past learning processes. In their opinion, the best option is to link the practice of TDD and experience.\nBaby steps and simplicity\nTDD suggests developers to work in small (baby) steps; one should define the smallest possible functionality, write the simplest code that makes the test green, and do one refactoring at a time.\nIn the interviews, participants commented about this. One of them mentioned that, when not writing tests, a developer thinks about the class design at once, creating a more complex structure than needed.\nOne of the participants clearly stated how he makes use of baby steps, and how it helps him think better about his class design:\n“Because we start to think of the small and not the whole. When I do TDD, I write a simple rule (...), and then I write the method. If the test passes, it passes! As you go step by step, the architecture gets nice. (...) I used to think about the whole (...). I think our brain works better when you think small. If you think big, it is clear, at least for me, that you will end up forgetting something. ”\nRefactoring confidence\nParticipants affirmed that, during the process of class design, changing minds is constant. After all, there is still a small knowledge about the problem, and about how the class should be built. This was the most mentioned point by the participants. According to them, an intrinsic advantage of TDD is the generated test suite. It allows developers to change their minds and refactor all the class design safely. Confidence, according to them, is an important factor when changing class design or even implementation.\n\"It gives me the opportunity to learn along the way and make things differently. (…). The test gives you confidence.\"\nA participant even mentioned a real experience, in which TDD made the difference. According to him, he changed his mind about the class design many times and trusted the test suite to guarantee the expected behavior.\nA safe space to think\nIn an analogy done by one of the participants, tests are like draft paper, in which they can try different approaches and change their minds about it frequently. According to them, when starting by the test, developers are, for the first time, using their own class. It makes developers look for a better and clearer way to invoke the class’ behaviors, and facilitate its use:\n\"Tests help you on that. They are a draft for you to try to model it the best way you can. If you had to model the class only once, it is like if you have only one chance. Or if you make it wrong, fixing it would give you a lot of work. The idea of you having tests and thinking about them, it is like if you have an empty draft sheet, in which you can put and remove stuff because that stuff doesn’t even exist.\"\nWe asked their reasons for not thinking on the class design even when they were not practicing TDD or writing tests. According to them, when a developer does not practice TDD, they get too focused on the code they are writing, and thus, they end up not thinking about the class design they were creating. They believe tests make them think of how the class being created will interact with the other classes and of the easiness of using it.\nOne of the participants was even more precise in his statement. According to him, developers that do not practice TDD, as they do not think about the class design they are building, they end up not doing good use of OOP. TDD forces developers to speed down, allowing them to think better about what they are doing.\nRapid feedback\nParticipants also commented that one difference they perceived when they practiced TDD was the constant feedback. In traditional testing, the time between the production code writing and test code writing is too long. When practicing TDD, developers are forced to write the test first, and thus receive the feedback a test can provide sooner.\nOne participant commented that, from the test, developers observe and criticize the code they are designing. As the tests are done constantly, developers end up continuously thinking about the code and its quality:\n\"When you write the test, you soon perceive what you don’t like in it (...). You don’t perceive that until you start using tests.\"\nReducing the time between the code writing and test writing also helps developers to create code that effectively solves the problem. According to the participants, in traditional testing, developers write too much code before actually knowing if it works.\nThe search for testability\nMaybe the main reason for the practice of TDD helping developers in their class design is the constant search for testability. It is possible to infer that, when starting to produce code by its test, the production code should be, necessarily, testable.\nWhen it is not easy to test a specific piece of code, developers understand it as a class design smell. When this happens, developers usually try to refactor the code to make it easier to test. A participant also affirmed that he takes it as a rule; if it is hard to test, then the code may be improved.\nFeathers [7] raised this point: the harder it is to write the test, the higher the chance of a class design problem. According to him, there is a strong synergy between a highly testable class and a good class design; if developers are looking for testability, they end up creating good class design; if they are looking for good class design, they end up writing testable code.\nParticipants went even further. During the interviews, many of them mentioned patterns that made (and make) them think about possible design problems in the class they build. As an example, they told us that when they feel the need to write many different unit tests to a single method, this may be a sign of a non-cohesive method. They also said that when a developer feels the need to write a big scenario for a single class or method, it is possible to infer that this need emerges in classes dealing with too many objects or containing too many responsibilities, and thus, it is not cohesive. They also mentioned how they detect coupling issues. According to them, the abusive use of mocking objects indicates that the class under testing has coupling issues.\nWhat did we learn from it?\nThe first interesting myth contested by the participants was the idea that the practice of TDD would drive developers towards a better design by itself. As they explained, the previous experience and knowledge in good design is what makes the difference; however, TDD helps developers by giving feedback by means of the unit tests that they are writing constantly. As they also mentioned, the search for testability also makes them rethink about the class design many times during the day — if a class is not easy to be tested, then they refactor it.\nWe agree with the rationale. In fact, when comparing to test-last approaches, developers do not have the constant feedback or the need to write testable code. They will have the same feedback only at the end, when all the production code is already written. That may be too late (or expensive) to make a big refactoring in the class design.\n\nWe also agree with the confidence when refactoring. As TDD forces developers to write unit tests frequently, those tests end up working as a safety net. Any broken change in the code is quickly identified. This safety net makes developers more confident to try and experiment new design changes — after all, if the changes break anything, tests will warn developers about it. That is why they also believe the tests are a safe space to think.\nTherefore, we believe that is is not the practice by itself that helps developers to improve their class design; but it is the consequences of the constant act of writing a unit test, make that class testable, and refactor the code, that drives developers through a better design.\nConclusion: Developers believe that the practice of test-driven development helps them to improve their class design, as the constant need of writing a unit test for each piece of the software forces them to create testable classes. These small feedbacks — is your test easy to be tested or not? — makes them think and rethink about the class and improve it. Also, as the number of tests grow, they act as a safety net, allowing developers to refactor freely, and also try and experiment different approaches to that code. Based on that, we suggest developers to experiment the practice of test-driven development, as its effects look positive to software developers.\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nWe have the following skeleton for a diagram illustrating the Test Driven Development cycle.\nWhat words/sentences should be at the numbers?\n\n(Try to answer the question without scrolling up!)\nExercise 2.\nRemember the RomanNumeral problem?\n**The Roman Numeral problem**\n\nIt is our goal to implement a program that receives a string as a parameter\ncontaining a roman number and then converts it to an integer.\n\nIn roman numeral, letters represent values:\n\n* I = 1\n* V = 5\n* X = 10\n* L = 50\n* C = 100\n* D = 500\n* M = 1000\n\nWe can combine these letters to form numbers.\nThe letters should be ordered from the highest to the lowest value.\nFor example `CCXVI` would be 216.\n\nWhen we put a lower value in front of a higher one, we substract that value from the higher value.\nFor example we make 40 not by XXXX, but instead we use {% math %}50 - 10 = 40{% endmath %} and have the roman number `XL`.\nCombining both these principles we could give our method `MDCCCXLII` and it should return 1842.\nImplement this program. Practice TDD!\nExercise 3.\nWhich of the following is the least important reason why one does Test-Driven Development?\n\nAs a consequence of the practice of TDD, software systems get completely tested.\nTDD practitioners use the feedback from the test code as a design hint.\nThe practice of TDD enables developers to have steady, incremental progress throughout the development of a feature.\nThe use of mocks objects helps developers to understand the relationships between objects.\n\nExercise 4.\nTDD has become a really popular practice among developers. According to them, TDD has several benefits. Which of the following statements \nis not considered a benefit from the practice of TDD?\nNote: We are looking at the perspective of developers, which may not always match the results of empirical research.\n\nBetter team integration. Writing tests is a social activity and makes the team more aware of their code quality. \n\nBaby steps. Developers can take smaller steps whenever they feel they have to.\n\nRefactoring. The cycle suggests developers to constantly improve their code.\n\nDesign for testability. Developers are \"forced\" to write testable code from the very beginning.\n\n\nReferences\n\nBeck, K.

This is what happens in practice:\nthe test code base grows up very fast. And\nlike with the production code, we have to put some extra effort in making high-quality test code bases so that we can maintain and evolve them in a\nsustainable way.\nIn this chapter, we go over some good practices \nfor writing test code. We'll discuss the so-called test code smells.\nThese test smells are structures or pieces of code you see in the test code base that indicate problems in the test code or in the system. This is a clear\nanalogy to code smells, however focused on test code.\nTo understand how to write good test code, we first should understand\nthe structure of a test method.\nAutomated tests are very similar in structure.\nThey almost always follow the AAA (\"triple A\") structure.\nThis acronym stands for Arrange, Act, and Assert.\nIn the Arrange phase, we get everything we need to execute the test.\nThis usually means initializing some object and/or setting up some values.\nSome people call it the \"set up of the test\". In practice, this is where\nwe write the inputs we devised using any of the testing techniques\nwe discussed.\nThe Act phase is where the production code under test is exercised.\nIt is usually done by means of one or many method calls.\nThe result is then used in the Assert phase, where we assert that it is what we expect it to be.\nWe have an automated test:\n@Test\npublic void nonLeapCenturialYears() {\n    // this is the arrange\n1.  int year = 1500;\n\n    // this is the act\n2.  LeapYear ly = new LeapYear();\n3.  boolean leap = ly.isLeapYear(year);\n\n    // this is the assert\n4.  assertFalse(leap);\n}\n\nThis test is made for the LeapYear class and tests the isLeapYear method.\nWe find the arrange part at the start: we define 1500 as the year we \nwant to pass to the production method.\nThen we use this value as an input to the method under test in lines 2 and 3.\nThis is the act part; we use the production code to find a result for a certain input.\nIn line 4, we assert that the result is false.\n\n\n\n\nThe FIRST principles\nNow, let's discuss some best practices in test code.\nWe will discuss the \"FIRST Properties of Good Tests\". They come originally\nfrom the Pragmatic Unit Testing book (see references). Each letter in the\nacronym represents one best practice.\n\nFast: \nIn practice, it is really important to run the test after each change, to check that the changes do not break anything.\nFor that to happen smmothly, the test execution should be fast. \nAlthough we do not have a hard line for when a test is slow or fast,\nthe idea is, however, that when it takes a long time to run a test, developers will not run the test all the time;\nit would take just too much of their time.\nIn order to keep our tests fast, we should use as few slow dependencies as possible.\nWe have already seen a way to do this with mock objects.\n\nIsolated: When writing a test, we want this specific test to be as isolated as possible in a two different perspectives.\nThe first one is in terms of what it tests.\nThe test should check an isolated piece of functionality.\nFollowing this, good unit tests only focus on small pieces of code or in single\nfunctionalities.\nAnother perspective is the isolation from other tests.\nTests should not depend on each other.\nWhen, for example, test A only works when test B runs before, tests are not independent anymore.\nTo avoid such dependency, you have to be careful with shared resources between the tests, e.g., databases, files. The resources have to be the same at the end of a test as they were at the beginning (i.e., your tests should \"clean their messes up\" at the end of their execution).\n\nRepeatable: A repeatable test is a test that gives the same result, no matter how many times it is executed.\nIf a test sometimes fails and sometimes passes, without any changes in the system, you suddenly loose confidence in that test.\nRepeatable tests are related to isolated tests. A test that is not so well isolated tend to be not repeatable. (We will call these tests, flaky tests later on in this chapter).\n\nSelf-validating/Self-arranging: The tests should validate the result themselves.\nWe write test code to automate the tests, so that we do have to compare the results ourselves.\nTests are made self-validating by using assertions. Tests should act as oracles:\nthey should make sure that the program behaved as expeted.\nWhen we talk about self-validating, we should also talk about self-arranging.\nThis means that the test should reach the required initial state itself.\nFor example, if the production code uses a database and requires that this database is in some state before running, the test should make sure that this database contains the necessary data to run the code.\n\nTimely: The final property is timely.\nNow, we are not talking just about the code, but also about the development process.\nAutomated tests should be written often and shortly after the production code.\nIf we leave automated tests to the end of the process, e.g., long after the production code is written, chances are that they will not be written at all.\nWe should become \"test infected\"! Testing the software should become a habit.\n(We also discuss the idea of Test-Driven Development, or development guided by the tests in a specific chapter.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Desiderata\nKent Beck, the \"creator\" of Test-Driven Development (and author of the fantastic\n\"Test-Driven Development: By Example\" book), recently wrote a list of eleven\nproperties that good tests have (the test desiderata). \nDirectly from his blog post (each link below points to a YouTube video he recorded about the topic):\n\nIsolated — tests should return the same results regardless of the order in which they are run.\nComposable — if tests are isolated, then I can run 1 or 10 or 100 or 1,000,000 and get the same results.\nFast — tests should run quickly.\nInspiring — passing the tests should inspire confidence\nWritable — tests should be cheap to write relative to the cost of the code being tested.\nReadable — tests should be comprehensible for reader, invoking the motivation for writing this particular test.\nBehavioral — tests should be sensitive to changes in the behavior of the code under test. If the behavior changes, the test result should change.\nStructure-insensitive — tests should not change their result if the structure of the code changes.\nAutomated — tests should run without human intervention.\nSpecific — if a test fails, the cause of the failure should be obvious.\nDeterministic — if nothing changes, the test result shouldn't change.\nPredictive — if the tests all pass, then the code under test should be suitable for production.\n\nTest Smells\nNow that we covered some best practices we can start looking at the other\nside of the coin, the test smells.\nIn production code we use the term code smells for indications or symptoms that indicate a deeper problem in the system.\nSome very well-known examples are Long Method, Long Class, or God Class.\nA good number of research papers show us that code smells hinder the comprehensibility and the maintainability of software systems.\nCode smells can also occur in the test code.\nWe call them test smells.\nResearch also shows that these test smells occur a lot in real life and, unsurprisingly, often negatively impact the system.\nFor example, a paper by Bavota and his co-authors shows that the test smells are widely spread and negatively impact the comprehensibility of the code.\nAnother study by Spadini and his co-authors says that tests, that are affected by test smells, have defects and are changed more often than tests that are not affected.\nYou will see that most of these smells can be mapped to one of the best practices.\nThroughout this chapter we will go over some test smells and how to avoid them.\nThere are more test smells you can study, though. A good reference for future studies here is the xUnit Test Patterns book, by\nMeszaros.\nOne common test smell is Code Duplication.\nIt is not surprising that this is a test smell, as it is also very common in production code.\nWe already noted that the tests are all very similar in structure.\nWith that we can very easily get code duplication.\nDevelopers often just copy paste the code instead of coming up with some private method, or more generally, abstractions.\nThe problem with duplicate code is mostly its effect on the maintainability of code.\nIf there is a need for a change in the duplicated piece of code, you will have to apply the change in all the places where the code was duplicated. \nIn practice, it is very easy to forget one of the places, and you end up with problematic code in your tests.\nThis is similar to the impact of code duplication in production code.\nBecause of its effect on the maintainability of a system, code duplication is considered to be a test smell.\nAnother very common test smell is called Assertion Roulette.\nAssertion roulette is when a test fails, and it is very hard for the developers to understand the failing assertion, i.e., why does it fail?\nThis is problematic, as the developer cannot see what is going wrong exactly and therefore cannot fix the error.\nAssertion roulette can happen due to a couple of reasons.\nThe first one is the amount of assertions in the test.\nA test that contains a lot of assertions might make the life of developer more difficult when one assertion fails. After all, understanding the full context of a complex sequence of assertions is just harder than understanding the full context of a simple sequence of assertions.\nSometimes just adding a comment, or JUnit message in the assertion can help.\nAnother widely used strategy is called the \"one assertion per method\" strategy.\nWith that strategy, we aim to have the least amount of assertions in a test method as possible.\nThis can be taken to the extreme by just allowing exactly one assertion per method.\nMore pragmatically though, when you see a test method with a lot of assertions, you can probably think about splitting it up in a couple separate tests.\nThe next test smell corresponds to the Fast of FIRST principles: Slow tests.\nAs we discussed, test cases should be fast, because then the developers can run the test after each small change they make.\nSlower tests will be executed less frequently and therefore give less feedback to the developer.\nWhen you encounter a slow test you should really try to speed it up.\nIf you have a very slow dependency, you could for example try to mock it.\nAnother test smell relates to the Self-arranging of FIRST: Resource Optimism.\nResource optimism happens when a test assumes that a necessary resource (e.g., a database) is readily available at the start of its execution.\nAgain, with the database example: to avoid resource optimism, a test should not assume that the database is already in the correct state, and should set up the state there itself, by means of, for example, INSERT instructions at the beginning of the test method.\nAnother type of resource optimism is assuming that the resource is available all the time.\nWhen we are using a webservice, for example, this might not always be the case, as the webservice might be down for reasons we do not control.\nTo avoid this test smell, you have two options:\nOne is again to avoid using external resources, by using mock objects.\nIf you cannot avoid using the external dependencies, you can make the test robust enough.\nIn that case, you can skip the test when the resource is unavailable, and provide a message explaining why the test was skipped.\nThis is, at least, better than letting the test fail for a bad reason.\nIn addition to changing your tests, you have to make sure that all the environments that the tests are executed have the required resources available.\nContinuous integration tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, and Travis can help you in making sure that you run the tests always in the same environment.\nThe next test smell is Test Run War.\nThis happens when the tests pass if you execute them alone, but fail as soon as someone else runs the test at the same time.\nThis often happen when the tests consume the same resource, e.g., the same database.\nImagine a test suite that communicates to a global database. When developer 1 runs the test, the test changes the state of the database; at the same time, developer 2 runs the same test that also goes to the same database. Now, both tests are touching the same database at the same time. This unexpected situation which might make the test to fail.\nIf you feel like we talked about this before, you are correct; this smell is highly related to the Isolation of the FIRST princinples.\nWhen you encounter a Test Run War, make sure to isolate them well.\nAnother test smell that we often encounter is the General Fixture.\nA fixture basically means the arrange part of the test, where we create all the objects and inputs needed by the test.\nWe often see developers creating one large method (using, for example, the @BeforeEach annotation of JUnit) that creates all the objects needed by the all tests.\nHaving such a fixture is not necessarily a problem. However, when test A uses just part of this fixture, and part B uses just another part, this means that this fixture is too generic.\nThe problem with a generic fixture is that it becomes very hard to understand what a single test really needs and uses.\nTo resolve this issue, you have to make sure that the tests contain clear and concise fixures, nothing more than what it really needs.\nExplore the design pattern called Test Data Builder, that helps us in avoiding this test smell.\nThe Indirect tests smell concerns the class that is tested by a test class.\nWhen the test goes beyond testing the class under test, but also tests other classes, we call it an indirect test.\nThis might problematic due to the change propagation that might happen in this test. Imagine a test class ATest that tests not only class A, but also class B. If a bug exists in class B, we expect tests in BTest to fail; however, the tests for class A in ATest will also break, due to \nthis indirect testing.\nThese extra failing tests are cumbersome and might cost a good amount of time from the developer.\nWe should try as much as possible to keep our tests focused, making sure that they do not indirectly test other classes.\nFinally, we have the test smell called Sensitive Equality.\nWe use assertions to verify that the production code behaves as expected.\nThis test smell is when we have assertions that are too strict. Or, in other\nwords, too sensitive. We want our tests to be as resilient as possible, and only break if there is indeed a bug in the system. We do not want small changes that do not affect the behavior of the class to break our tests.\nA clear example of such a smell is when the developer decides to use\nthe results of a toString() method to assert the expected behavior.\nImagine an assertion like Assertion.assertTrue(invoice.toString().contains(\"Playstation\")).\ntoString()s change quite often; but a change in toString() should not\nbreak all the tests... If the developer had made the assertion to focus\non the specific property, e.g., Assertion.assertEquals(\"Playstation\", invoice.getProduct().getName()), this would not had happened.\nAgain, all these test smells are covered more in-depth in XUnit Test Patterns by Gerard Meszaros.\nWe highly recommend you to read that book!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlaky Tests\nIt is unfortunately quite common to have tests in our test suite\nthat sometimes passes, but sometimes fails. We do not like these tests;\nafter all, if a test gives us false positives, we can not really trust on them.\nWe call such tests, flaky tests.\nFlaky tests can have a lot of causes.\nWe will name a few examples:\n\nA test could be flaky, because it depends on an external and/or shared resource.\nLet's say we need a database to run our tests.\nSometimes the test passes, because the database is available; sometimes it fails, because then the database is not available.\nIn this case, the test depends on the availability of an external infrastructure.\n\nThe tests can also be flaky because of time-outs.\nThis cause is common in web applications.\nWith timeouts, the test waits for something to happen in the web application, e.g.,\na new message to appear in an HTML element.\nIf the web application is a bit slower than normal, the test will suddenly fail.\n\nFinally we could have interacting tests, which we also discussed above.\nThen test A influences the result of test B, possibly causing it to fail.\nAll these examples are plausible causes of flakiness that actually occur in practice.\n\n\nAs you might have notices, a lot of the causes of flaky tests correspond to scenarios we described when discussing the test smells.\nThe quality of our test code is indeed very important!\nIf you want to find the exact cause of a flaky test, the author of the XUnit Test Patterns book has made a whole decision table.\nYou can find it in the book or on Gerard Meszaros' website here.\nWith the decision table you can find a probable cause for the flakiness of your test.\nFor example: Does the flaky test get worse over time?\nThis means if the test gets slower and slower to execute.\nIf this is true, you probably have a resource leakage in the tests, otherwise it is probably a non-deterministic test.\nIf you want to read more about flaky tests, we suggest the following papers and blog posts (including Google discussing how problematic flaky tests are for their development teams):\n\nLuo, Q., Hariri, F., Eloussi, L., & Marinov, D.

The variables tax and\namount also now clearly explain what the previously \"magic numbers with no explanation\" mean.\n\nFinally we have a small tip for assertions.\nWhen an assertions fails, a developer should be able to quickly see what is going wrong in order to fix the fault in the code.\nIf the assertion in your test is complex, you might want to express it in a different way. For example, you might create a helper that performs this assertion step by step, so that a developer can easily follow the idea. Or you might want to add an explanatory message to the assertion. Or, even, why not a code comment?\nFrameworks like AssertJ have become really popular among developers, due to its expresiveness in assertions.\n\nExample here of assertj\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nJeanette just heard that two tests are behaving strangely: when executed in isolation, both of them pass. However, when executed together, they fail. Which one of the following is not cause for this?\n\nBoth tests are very slow.\nThey depend upon the same external resources.\nThe execution order of the tests matter.\nThey do not perform a clean-up operation after execution.\n\nExercise 2.\nRepoDriller is a project that extracts information from Git repositories. Its integration tests consumes lots of real Git repositories, each one with a different characteristic, e.g., one repository contains a merge commit, another repository contains a revert operation, etc.\nIts tests look like what you see below:\n@Test\npublic void test01() {\n\n  // arrange: specific repo\n  String path = \"test-repos/git-4\";\n\n  // act\n  TestVisitor visitor = new TestVisitor();\n  new RepositoryMining()\n  .in(GitRepository.singleProject(path))\n  .through(Commits.all())\n  .process(visitor)\n  .mine();\n\n  // assert\n  Assert.assertEquals(3, visitor.getVisitedHashes().size());\n  Assert.assertTrue(visitor.getVisitedHashes().get(2).equals(\"b8c2\"));\n  Assert.assertTrue(visitor.getVisitedHashes().get(1).equals(\"375d\"));\n  Assert.assertTrue(visitor.getVisitedHashes().get(0).equals(\"a1b6\"));\n}\n\nWhich test smell does this piece of code suffers from?\n\nMystery guest\nCondition logic in test\nGeneral fixture\nFlaky test\n\nExercise 3.\nIn the code below, we present the source code of an automated test.\nHowever, Joe, our new test specialist, believes this test is smelly and it can be better written.\nWhich of the following could be Joe's main concern?\n\nThe test contains code that may or may not be executed, making the test less readable.\nIt is hard to tell which of several assertions within the same test method will cause a test failure.\nThe test depends on external resources and has nondeterministic results depending on when/where it is run.\nThe test reader is not able to see the cause and effect between fixture and verification logic because part of it is done outside the test method.\n\n@Test\npublic void flightMileage() {\n  // setup fixture\n  // exercise contructor\n  Flight newFlight = new Flight(validFlightNumber);\n  // verify constructed object\n  assertEquals(validFlightNumber, newFlight.number);\n  assertEquals(\"\", newFlight.airlineCode);\n  assertNull(newFlight.airline);\n  // setup mileage\n  newFlight.setMileage(1122);\n  // exercise mileage translater\n  int actualKilometres = newFlight.getMileageAsKm();    \n  // verify results\n  int expectedKilometres = 1810;\n  assertEquals(expectedKilometres, actualKilometres);\n  // now try it with a canceled flight\n  newFlight.cancel();\n  boolean flightCanceledStatus = newFlight.isCancelled();\n  assertFalse(flightCanceledStatus);\n}\n\nExercise 4.\nSee the test code below. What is the most likely test code smell that this piece of code presents?\n@Test\nvoid test1() {\n  // webservice that communicates with the bank\n  BankWebService bank = new BankWebService();\n\n  User user = new User(\"d.bergkamp\", \"nl123\");\n  bank.authenticate(user);\n  Thread.sleep(5000); // sleep for 5 seconds\n\n  double balance = bank.getBalance();\n  Thread.sleep(2000);\n\n  Payment bill = new Payment();\n  bill.setOrigin(user);\n  bill.setValue(150.0);\n  bill.setDescription(\"Energy bill\");\n  bill.setCode(\"YHG45LT\");\n\n  bank.pay(bill);\n  Thread.sleep(5000);\n\n  double newBalance = bank.getBalance();\n  Thread.sleep(2000);\n\n  // new balance should be previous balance - 150\n  Assertions.assertEquals(newBalance, balance - 150);\n}\n\n\nFlaky test.\nTest code duplication.\nObscure test.\nLong method.\n\nExercise 5.\nIn the code below, we show an actual test from Apache Commons Lang, a very popular open source Java library. This test focuses on the static random() method, which is responsible for generating random characters. A very interesting detail in this test is the comment: Will fail randomly about 1 in 1000 times.\n/**\n * Test homogeneity of random strings generated --\n * i.e., test that characters show up with expected frequencies\n * in generated strings.

These tests will never fail!\nFault Detection Capability\nLet's discuss one more adequacy criterion: the fault detection capability.\nIt indicates the test's capability to reveal faults in the system under test.\nThe more faults a test can detect, in other words, the more faults a test fails on, the higher its fault detection capability.\nUsing this criterion, we can indicate the quality of our test suite in a better way than with just the coverage metrics we have so far.\nThe fault detection capability does not just regard the amount of production code executed, but also the assertions made in the test cases.\nFor a test to be adequate according to this criterion, it has to have a meaningful test oracle (i.e., meaningful assertions).\nThe fault detection capability, as a test adequacy criterion, is the fundamental idea behind mutation testing.\nIn mutation testing, we change small parts of the code, and check if the tests can find the introduced fault.\nIn the previous example, we made a test suite that was not adequate at all, according to the fault detection capability.\nAs there were no assertions, the tests would never find any faults in the code.\n@Test\npublic void testGetValues() {\n  int[] values = Division.getValues(1, 1);\n  assertEquals(1, values[0]);\n  assertEquals(0, values[1]);\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void testZero() {\n  int[] values = Division.getValues(1, 0);\n  assertNull(values);\n}\n\nTests with assertions check if the result of the method is what we expect. We have a test oracle now.\nTo see how the values in a test case influence the fault detection capability, let's create two tests, where the denominator is not 0.\n@Test\npublic void testGetValuesOnes() {\n  int[] values = Division.getValues(1, 1);\n  assertEquals(1, values[0]);\n  assertEquals(0, values[1]);\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void testGetValuesDifferent() {\n  int[] values = Division.getValues(3, 2);\n  assertEquals(1, values[0]);\n  assertEquals(1, values[1]);\n}\n\nFor the fault detection capability, we want to see if the tests catch any faults that could be in the code.\nThis means we have to go back to the source code and introduce an error:\npublic class Division {\n  public static int[] getValues(int a, int b) {\n    if (b == 0) {\n      return null;\n    }\n    int quotient = a * b; // the bug was introduced here\n    int remainder = a % b;\n\n    return new int[] {quotient, remainder};\n  }\n}\n\nWe replace the division by a multiplication; a clear bug.\nIf we run our tests with the buggy code, we see that the test with the values 1 and 1 (the testGetValuesOnes() test) still passes, but the other test (the testGetValuesDifferent()) fails.\nThis indicates that the second test has a higher fault detection capability.\nEven though both tests exercise the method in the same way and execute the same lines, we see a difference in the fault detection capability.\nThis is because of the different input values for the method and the different test oracles (assertions) in the tests.\nIn this case, the input values and test oracle of the testGetValuesDifferent() test can better detect that bug.\n\n\n\n\nHypotheses for Mutation Testing\nWe are now ready to generalize the idea.\nThe idea of mutation testing is to assess the quality of the test suite.\nThis is done by manipulating the source code a bit and running the tests with this manipulated source code.\nIf we have a good test suite, at least one of the tests will fail on this changed (buggy) code.\nFollowing this procedure, we get a sense of the fault error capability of our test suite.\nIn mutation testing we use mutants.\nThe mutants are the defects, or faults, that we introduce in the source code and then use to determine the quality of the test suite.\nA big question regarding the mutants is what their size should be.\nWe can change single operations, whole lines or even multiple lines of code.\nWhat would work best?\nMutation testing and the answer to this question are based on the following two hypotheses:\n\nThe Competent Programmar Hypothesis (CPH):\nHere, we assume that the program is written by a competent programmer.\nMore importantly, this means that given a certain specification, the programmer creates a program that is either correct, or it differs from a correct program by a combination of simple errors.\n\nThe Coupling Effect:\nThe coupling effect hypothesis states that simple faults are coupled to more complex faults.\nIn other words, test cases that detect simple faults, will also detect complex faults.\n\n\nBased on these two hypotheses, we can determine the size \nthat the mutants should have.\nRealistically, following the competent programmer hypothesis, \nthe faults in actual code will be small.\nThis indicates that the mutants' size should be small as well.\nConsidering the coupling effect, test cases that detect \nsmall errors, will also be able to detect larger, more complex errors.\nTerminology\nTo talk about mutation testing in a depth way, let's define some terms:\n\nMutant: Given a program PPP, a mutant called P′P'P​′​​ is obtained by introducing a syntactic change to PPP. A mutant is killed if a test fails when executed with the mutant.\nSyntactic Change: A small change in the code. Such a small change should make the code still valid, i.e., the code can still compile and run.\nChange: A change, or alternation, to the code that mimic typical human mistakes. We will see some examples of these mistakes later.\n\nWe illustrate mutation testing with these concepts in the example below.\nSuppose we have a Fraction class with a method invert().\npublic class Fraction {\n  private int numerator;\n  private int denominator;\n\n  // ...\n\n  public Fraction invert() {\n1.  if (numerator == 0) {\n2.    throw new ArithmeticException(\"...\");\n    }\n3.  if (numerator == Integer.MIN_VALUE) {\n4.    throw new ArithmeticException(\"...\");\n    }\n5.  if (numerator \nWe have a small test suite for this method as well.\n@Test\npublic void testInvert(){\n  Fraction f = new Fraction(1, 2);\n  Fraction result = f.invert();\n  assertEquals(2, result.getFloat(), 0.00001);\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void testInvertNegative(){\n  Fraction f = new Fraction(-1, 2);\n  Fraction result = f.invert();\n  assertEquals(-2, result.getFloat(), 0.00001);\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void testInvertZero(){\n  Fraction f = new Fraction(0, 2);\n  assertThrows(ArithmeticException.class, () -> f.invert());\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void testInvertMinValue(){\n  int n = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n  Fraction f = new Fraction(n, 2);\n  assertThrows(ArithmeticException.class, () -> f.invert());\n}\n\nWe have two tests for some corner cases that throw an exception, and two more \"happy path\" tests.\nNow, we want to determine the quality of our test suite, using mutation testing.\nFirst, we have to create a mutant by applying a syntactic change to the original method.\nKeep in mind that, because of the two hypotheses, we want the syntactic change to be small: one operation/variable should be enough.\nMoreover, the syntactic change is a change, hence it should mimic mistakes that could be made by a programmer.\nFor the first mutant we change line 6.\nInstead of -numerator we just say numerator.\nThe mutant looks like as follows:\npublic class Fraction {\n  private int numerator;\n  private int denominator;\n\n  // ...\n\n  public Fraction invert() {\n1.  if (numerator == 0) {\n2.    throw new ArithmeticException(\"...\");\n    }\n3.  if (numerator == Integer.MIN_VALUE) {\n4.    throw new ArithmeticException(\"...\");\n    }\n5.  if (numerator \nIf we would execute the test suite on this mutant, the testInvertNegative() test will fail, as result.getFloat() would be positive instead of negative.\nAnother mistake could be made in line 1.\nWhen we studied boundary analysis, we saw that it is important to test the boundaries due to off-by-one errors.\nWe can make a syntactic change by introducing such an off-by-on error.\nInstead of numerator == 0, in our new mutant we make it numerator == 1:\npublic class Fraction {\n  private int numerator;\n  private int denominator;\n\n  // ...\n\n  public Fraction invert() {\n1.  if (numerator == 1) {\n2.    throw new ArithmeticException(\"...\");\n    }\n3.  if (numerator == Integer.MIN_VALUE) {\n4.    throw new ArithmeticException(\"...\");\n    }\n5.  if (numerator \nWe see that, again, the test suite catches this error.\nThe test testInvertZero() will fail, as it expects an exception, but none is thrown in the mutant.\nAutomation\nManually writing the mutations of our programs takes a lot of time, \nand we probably would only think of the cases that are already tested.\nLike with test execution, we want to automate the mutation process.\nThere are various tools that automatically generate mutants for mutant testing, but they all use the same methodology.\nFirst we need mutation operators.\nA mutation operator is a grammatic rule that can be used to introduce a syntactic change.\nThis means that, if the generator sees a statement in the code that corresponds to the grammatic rule of the operator (e.g., a + b), then the mutation operator specifies how to change this statement with a syntactic change (e.g., turning it into a - b for example).\nWe distinguish two categories of mutation operators:\n\nReal fault based operators: Operators that are very similar to defects seen in the past for the same kind of code. Such operators look like common mistakes made by programmers in similar code.\nLanguage-specific operators: Mutations that are made specifically for a certain programming language. For example, changes related to the inheritance feature we have in the Java language, or changes regarding pointer manipulations in C, which we cannot simply apply to all the languages.\n\nMost mutation testing tools include various basic mutation operators for real fault based operators.\nWe briefly go over some common mutation operators:\n\nAOR - Arithmetic Operator Replacement: Replaces an arithmetic operator by another arithmetic operator. Arithmetic operators are +, -, *, /, %.\nROR - Relational Operator Replacement: Replaces a relational operator by another relational operator. Relational operators are , >=, !=, ==, >, .\nCOR - Conditional Operator Replacement: Replaces a conditional operator by another conditional operator. Conditional operators are &&, ||, &, |, !, ^.\nAOR - Assignment Operator Replacement: Replaces an assignment operator by another assignment operator. Assignment operators include =, +=, -=, /=.\nSVR - Scalar Variable Replacement: Replaces each variable reference by another variable reference that has been declared in the code.\n\nFor each of the mutation operators, we provide an example.\nWe first show the original code, and then the mutant that could be given by the mutant operator.\nArithmetic Operator Replacement\nOriginal:\nint c = a + b;\n\nExample of a mutant:\nint c = a - b;\n\nRelational Operator Replacement\nOriginal:\nif (c == 0) {\n  return -1;\n}\n\nExample of a mutant:\nif (c > 0) {\n  return -1;\n}\n\nConditional Operator Replacement\nOriginal:\nif (a == null || a.length == 0) {\n  return new int[0];\n}\n\nExample of a mutant:\nif (a == null | a.length == 0) {\n  return new int[0];\n}\n\nAssignment Operator Replacement\nOriginal:\nc = a + b;\n\nExample of a mutant:\nc -= a + b;\n\nScalar Variable Replacement\nOriginal:\npublic class Division {\n  public static int[] getValues(int a, int b) {\n    if (b == 0 || b == Integer.MIN_VALUE){\n      return null;\n    }\n\n    int quotient = a / b;\n    int remainder = a % b;\n\n    return new int[] {quotient, remainder};\n  }\n}\n\nExample of a mutant:\npublic class Division {\n  public static int[] getValues(int a, int b) {\n    if (a == 0 || a == Integer.MIN_VALUE){\n      return null;\n    }\n\n    int quotient = b / a;\n    int remainder = quotient % a;\n\n    return new int[] {remainder, a};\n  }\n}\n\nSpecifically to Java, there are a lot of language-specific operators.\nWe can, for example, change the inheritance of the class, remove an overriding method, or change some declaration types.\nWe will not go into detail about these language-specific mutant operators, but some examples are:\n\nAccess Modifier Change\nHiding Variable Deletion\nHiding Variable Insertion\nOverriding Method Deletion\nParent Constructor Deletion\nDeclaration Type Change\n\nOf course, there exist many more mutant operators that are used by mutant generators.\nFor now, you should at least have an idea what mutation operators are, how they work and what we can use them for.\n\n\n\nMutation Analysis and Testing\nNow that the concept of mutation testing and how to make it is clear,\nlet's look at how we can use mutation testing in practice.\nOur goal is to use mutation testing to determine the quality of our test suite.\nWe have seen that we first have to create the mutants and that it is best to do this in an automated way with the help of mutant operators.\nThen, we run the test suite against the created mutants with an execution engine.\nIf one of the tests fails, we say that the test suite kills the mutant.\nThis is good, as it suggests that our test suite has some fault detection capability.\nIf none of the tests in our test suite fails when executed against the mutant, this mutant stays alive.\nThis process is illustrated in the diagram below:\n\nWhen performing mutation testing, we count the number of mutants our test suite killed and the number of mutants that were still alive.\nBy counting the amount of each of these mutant groups, we can give a value to the quality of our test suite.\\\nWe define the Mutation Score as:\nMutation score =killed mutantsmutants\\text{Mutation score } = \\frac{\\text{killed mutants}}{\\text{mutants}}Mutation score =​mutants​​killed mutants​​\nComputing this mutation score is what we call mutation analysis.\nMore formally:\\\nMutation analysis means assessing the quality of a test suite, by computing its mutation score.\nWhen the mutation score is low, we might want to change or add new test cases in our test suite.\nThis is called mutation testing.\nAgain, the definition:\nMutation testing means improving the quality of the test suite using mutants (by adding and/or changing test cases).\nThese concepts are very related to each other.\nTo do mutation testing, you have to compute the mutation score first.\nThis then indicates whether the test suite should be changed.\nIf the mutation score is low, there are a lot of mutants that are not killed by the test suite.\nThen, it is indeed our job to improve the test suite.\nEquivalent Mutants\nCalculating the mutation score is, in practice, challenging. Why?\nThe mutation score increases when less mutants are alive.\nThis suggests that the best scenario is to have all the mutants killed by the test suite.\nWhile this is indeed the best scenario, it is often unrealistic.\nSome of the mutants are impossible to kill and will then always stay alive.\nThe mutants that cannot be killed are called equivalent mutants.\nAn equivalent mutant is a mutant that always behaves as the original program.\nIf the mutant behaves like the normal code, it will always give the same output as the original program for any given input.\nOf course, this makes this mutant (which is basically the same program as the one under test) impossible to be killed by the tests.\nHere, the equivalence is related to the definition of program equivalence.\nProgram equivalence roughly means that two programs are functionally equivalent when they produce the same output for every possible input.\nThis is also the equivalence between the normal code and an equivalent mutant.\nLet's have a look at the following method. We left some irrelevant parts out.\npublic void foo(int a) {\n  int index = 10;\n  while (...) {\n    // ...\n    index--;\n    if (index == 0)\n      break;\n  }\n}\n\nOur mutation testing tool generates a mutant using relational operator replacement.\nThe mutant is as follows:\npublic void foo(int a) {\n  int index = 10;\n  while (...) {\n    // ...\n    index--;\n    if (index \nNote how the original code decremented index, which started at 10, and breaked from the loop when index would be equal to 0.\nThe mutant works exactly the same, even though the condition is technically different.\nindex is still decremented from 10 to 0.\nBecause index will never be negative, the == operator does the same as the  operator.\nThe mutant produced by the generator is an equivalent mutant in this case.\nBecause of these equivalent mutants, we need to change the mutation score formula.\nWe do not want to take the equivalent mutants into account, as there is nothing wrong with the tests when they do not kill these mutants.\nThe new formula becomes:\nMutation score=killed mutantsnon-equivalent mutants\\text{Mutation score} = \\frac{\\text{killed mutants}}{\\text{non-equivalent mutants}}Mutation score=​non-equivalent mutants​​killed mutants​​\nFor the denominator, we just count the amount of non-equivalent mutants, instead of all the mutants.\nTo compute this new mutation score automatically, we would need a way to automatically determine whether a mutant is an equivalent mutant.\nUnfortunately, we cannot do this automatically.\nDetecting equivalent mutations is an undecidable problem. We can never be sure that a mutant behaves the same as the original program for every possible input.\nApplication\nMutation testing sounds like a great way to analyse and improve our test suites.\nThe question is, however, if we can actually use mutation testing in practice.\nFor example, we can ask ourselves whether a test suite with a higher mutation score actually finds more errors.\nA lot of research done in software engineering tries to bring some insights to this problem.\nAll the existing studies about mutation testing showed that mutants can indeed give a good indication for a test suite's fault detection capability, as long as the mutant operators are carefully selected and the equivalent mutants are removed.\nMore specifically, a study by Just et al. shows that mutant detection is positively correlated with real fault detection.\nIn other words, the more mutants a test suite detects, the more real faults the test suite can detect as well.\nEven more interesting is that this correlation is independent from the coverage.\nFurthermore, the correlation between mutant detection and fault detection is higher than the correlation between statement coverage and fault detection.\nSo, the mutation score provides a better measure for the fault detection capability than the test coverage.\nCost\nOf course, mutation testing is not without its costs.\nWe have to generate the mutants, possibly remove the equivalent mutants, and execute the tests with each mutant.\nIn fact, mutation testing is quite expensive, i.e., it takes a long time to perform.\nLet's assume we want to do some mutation testing.\nWe have:\n\nA code base with 300 Java classes\n10 test cases for each class\nEach test case takes 0.2 seconds on average\nThe total test execution time is then: 300⋅10⋅0.2=600s(10 min)300 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 0.2 = 600 s (10 \\text{ min})300⋅10⋅0.2=600s(10 min)\n\nThis execution time is for just the normal code.\nFor the mutation testing, we decide to generate on average 20 mutants per class.\nWe will have to execute the entire test suite of a class on each of the mutants.\nPer class, we need 20⋅10⋅0.2=4020 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 0.2 = 4020⋅10⋅0.2=40 seconds.\nIn total, the mutation testing will take 300⋅40=12000300 \\cdot 40 = 12000300⋅40=12000 seconds, or 3 hours and 20 minutes.\nIndeed mutation testing can take a very long time.\nBecause of this cost, researchers have tried to find ways to make mutation testing faster for a long time.\nBased on some observations, they came up with a couple of heuristics.\n\nThe first observation is that a test case can never kill a mutant if it does not cover the statement that changed (also known as the reachability condition).\nBased on this observation, we only have to run the test cases that cover the changed statement.\nThis reduces the amount of test cases to run and, with that, the execution time.\nFurthermore, once a test case kills a mutant, we do not have to run the other test cases anymore.\nThis is because the test suite needs at least one test case that kills the mutant.\nThe exact number of test cases killing the mutant does not really matter.\n\nA second oberservation is that mutants generated by the same operator and injected at the same location are likely to be coupled to the same type of fault.\nThis means that when we use a certain mutation operator (Arithmetic Operator Replacement, for example) and we replace the same statement with this mutant operator, we get two mutants that represent the same fault in the code.\nIt is then highly likely that if the test suite kills one of the mutants, it will also kill the others.\nAn heuristic that follows from this observation is to run the test suite against a subset of all the less mutants (a technique also known as do fewer).\nObviously, when we run the test suite against a smaller number of mutations, the overall testing will take less time.\nThe simplest way of selecting the subset of mutants is by means of random sampling.\nAs the name suggests, we just pick random mutants to consider.\nThis is a very simple, yet effective way to reduce the execution time.\n\n\nThere exist other heuristics to decrease the execution time, like e-selective or cluster mutants and operators, but we will not go into detail of those heuristics.\nTools\nTo perform mutation testing you can use one of many publicly available tools.\nThese tools are often made for specific programming languages.\nOne of the most mature mutation testing tools for Java is called PIT or pitest.\nPIT can be run from the command line, but it is also integrated in most popular IDEs (like Eclipse or IntelliJ).\nProject management tools like Maven or Gradle can also be configured to run PIT.\nAs PIT is a mutation testing tool, it generates the mutants and runs the test suites against these mutants.\nThen it generates easy to read reports based on the results.\nIn these reports, you can see the line coverage and mutation score per class.\nFinally, you can also see more detailed results in the source code and check which individual mutants were kept alive. Try it out!\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\nExercise 1.\n\"Crimes happen in a city. One way for us to know that the police is actually able to detect these crimes, we can simulate crimes and see whether the police is able to detect them.\"\nIn the analogy above, we can replace crimes by bugs, city by software, and police by test suite. What should we replace simulate crimes by?\n\nMutation testing\nFuzzing testing\nSearch-based software testing\nCombinatorial testing\n\nWe need to develop more exercises for this chapter\n\nReferences\n\nChapter 16 of the Software Testing and Analysis: Process, Principles, and Techniques.

All others help people in understanding that variation, different types of testing, is important.\nIntroduction to software testing automation\nWriting tests is fun, isn't it?\nSpecification-based testing\nExercise 1\nA group of inputs that all make a method behave the same way.\nExercise 2\nWe use the concept of equivalence partitioning to determine which tests can be removed.\nAccording to equivalence partitioning we only need to test one test case in a certain partition.\nWe can group the tests cases in their partitions:\n\nDivisible by 3 and 5: T1, T2\nDivisible by just 3 (not by 5): T4\nDivisible by just 5 (not by 3): T5\nNot divisible by 3 or 5: T3\n\nOnly the partition where the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 has two tests.\nTherefore we can only remove T1 or T2.\nExercise 3\nFollowing the category partition method:\n\nTwo parameters: key and value\nThe execution of the program does not depend on the value; it always inserts it into the map.\nWe can define different characteristics of the key:\nThe key can already be present in the map or not.\nThe key can be null.\n\n\nThe requirements did not give a lot of parameters and/or characteristics, so we do not have to add constraints.\nThe combinations are each of the possibilities for the key with any value, as the programs execution does not depend on the value.\nWe end up with three partitions:\nNew key\nExisting key\nnull key\n\n\n\nExercise 4\nWe go over each given partition and identify whether it is a valid partition:\n\nValid partition: Invalid numbers, which are too small.\nValid partition: Valid numbers\nInvalid partition: Contains some valid numbers, but the range is too small to cover the whole partition.\nInvalid partition: Same reason as number 3.\nValid partition: Invalid numbers, that are too large.\nInvalid partition: Contains both valid and invalid letters (the C is included in the domain).\nValid partition: Valid letters.\nValid partition: Invalid letters, past the range of valid letters.\n\nWe have the following valid partitions: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8.\nExercise 5\n\nP1: Element not present in the set\nP2: Element already present in the set\nP3: NULL element.\n\nThe specification clearly explicits the three different cases of the correct answer.\nExercise 6\nOption 4 is the incorrect one.\nThis is a functional based technique. No need for source code.\nExercise 7\nPossible actions:\n\nWe should treat pattern size 'empty' as exceptional, and thus, test it just once.\nWe should constraint the options in the 'occurences in a single line' category to happen only if 'occurences in the file' are either exactly one or more than one. % It does not make sense to have none occurences in a file and one pattern in a line.\nWe should treat 'pattern is improperly quoted' as exceptional, and thus, test it just once.\n\nBoundary testing\nExercise 1\nThe on-point is the value in the conditions: half.\nWhen i equals half the condition is false.\nThen the off-point makes the condition true and is as close to half as possible.\nThis makes the off-point half - 1.\nThe in-points are all the points that are smaller than half.\nPractically they will be from 0, as that is what i starts with.\nThe out-points are the values that make the condition false: all values equal to or larger than half.\nExercise 2\nThe decision consists of two conditions, so we can analyse these separately.\nFor n % 3 == 0 we have an on point of 3.\nHere we are dealing with an equality; the value can both go up and down to make the condition false.\nAs such, we have two off-points: 2 and 4.\nSimilarly to the first condition for n % 5 == 0 we have an on-point of 5.\nNow the off-points are 4 and 6.\nExercise 3\nThe on-point can be read from the condition: 570.\nThe off-point should make the condition false (the on-point makes it true): 571.\nAn example of an in-point is 483.\nThen the condition evaluates to true.\nAn example of an out-point, where the condition evaluates to false, is 893.\nExercise 4\n\nNote that we require 7 test cases in total: numberOfPoints  and numberOfLives > 10 each have one on- and one off-point.\nenergyLevel == 5 is an equality, so we have two off-points and one on-point.\nThis gives a total of 7 test cases.\nFor one of the first two conditions we need two typical rows. \\\nLet's rewrite the whole condition to: (c1 && c2) || c3.\nTo test c1 we have to make c2 true, otherwise the result will always be false. \\\nThe same goes for testing c2 and then making c1 true.\nHowever, when testing c3, we need to make (c1 && c2) false, otherwise the result will always be true.\nThat is why, when testing c3, c1 or c2 has to be false, i.e. and out-point instead of an in-point.\nTherefore we use two different typical rows for the numberOfLives variable.\nThe same could have been done with two typical rows for the numberOfPoints variable.\nExercise 5\nAn on-point is the (single) number on the boundary. It may or may not make the condition true. The off point is the closest number to the boundary that makes the condition to be evaluated to the opposite of the on point. Given it's an inequality, there's only a single off-point.\nExercise 6\non point = 1024, off point = 1025, in point = 1028, out point = 512\nThe on point is the number precisely in the boundary = 1024. off point is the closest number to the boundary and has the opposite result of on point. In this case, 1024 makes the condition false, so the off point should make it true. 1025. In point makes conditions true, e.g., 1028. Out point makes the condition false, e.g., 512.\nExercise 7\nWe should always test the behavior of our program when any expected data actually does not exist (EXISTENCE).\nStructural-based testing\nExercise 1\nExample of a test suite that achieves 100%100\\%100% line coverage:\n@Test\npublic void removeNullInListTest() {\n    LinkedList list = new LinkedList<>();\n\n    list.add(null);\n\n    assertTrue(list.remove(null));\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void removeElementInListTest() {\n    LinkedList list = new LinkedList<>();\n\n    list.add(7);\n\n    assertTrue(list.remove(7));\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void removeElementNotPresentInListTest() {\n    LinkedList list = new LinkedList<>();\n\n    assertFalse(list.remove(5))\n}\n\nNote that there exists a lot of test suites that achieve 100%100\\%100% line coverage, this is just an example.\nYou should have 3 tests.\nAt least one test is needed to cover lines 4 and 5 (removeNullInListTest in this case).\nThis test will also cover lines 1-3.\nThen a test for lines 9 and 10 is needed (removeElementInListTest).\nThis test also covers lines 6-8.\nFinally a third test is needed to cover line 11 (removeElementNotPresentInListTest).\nExercise 2\n\nL\\ in the diagram represents the line number of the code that is in the block or decision.\nExercise 3\nOption 1 is the false one.\nA minimal test suite that achieves 100\\% (either basic or full) condition has the same number of tests as a minimal test suite that achieves 100\\% branch coverage. All decisions have just a single branch, so condition coverage doesn't make a difference here. Moreover, a test case that exercises lines 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 achieves around 54\\% coverage (6/11).\nExercise 4\nExample of a test suite that achieves 100%100\\%100% branch coverage:\n@Test\npublic void removeNullAsSecondElementInListTest() {\n  LinkedList list = new LinkedList<>();\n\n  list.add(5);\n  list.add(null);\n\n  assertTrue(list.remove(null));\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void removeNullNotPresentInListTest() {\n  LinkedList list = new LinkedList<>();\n\n  assertFalse(list.remove(null));\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void removeElementSecondInListTest() {\n  LinkedList list = new LinkedList<>();\n\n  list.add(5);\n  list.add(7);\n\n  assertTrue(list.remove(7));\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void removeElementNotPresentInListTest() {\n  LinkedList list = new LinkedList<>();\n\n  assertFalse(list.remove(3));\n}\n\nThis is just one example of a possible test suite.\nOther tests can work just as well.\nYou should have a test suite of 4 tests.\nWith the CFG you can see that there are decisions in lines 1, 2, 3, 7 and 8.\nTo achieve 100%100\\%100% branch coverage each of these decisions must evaluate to true and to false at least once in the test suite.\nFor the decision in line 1, we need to remove null and something else than null. This is done with the removeElement and removeNull tests.\nThen for the decision in line 2 the node that remove is looking at should not be null and null at least once in the tests.\nThe node is null when the end of the list had been reached.\nThat only happens when the element that shouls be removed is not in the list.\nNote that the decision in line 2 only gets executed when the element to remove is null.\nIn the tests, this means that the element should be found and not found at least once. \nThe decision in line 3 checks if the node thet the method is at now has the element that should be deleted.\nThe tests should cover a case where the element is not the item that has to be removed and a case where the element is the item that should be removed.\nThe decisions in lines 7 and 8 are the same as in lines 2 and 3 respectively.\nThe only difference is that lines 7 and 8 will only be executed when the item to remove is not null.\nExercise 5\nFirst, we find the pairs of tests that can be used for each of the conditions:\n\nA: {2, 6}\nB: {1, 3}, {2, 4}, {5, 7}\nC: {5, 6}\n\nFor A and C we need the decisions 2, 5 and 6.\nThen you can choose to add either 4 or 7 to cover condition B.\nThe possible answers are: {2, 4, 5, 6} or {2, 5, 6, 7}.\nExercise 6\n\nL\\ represents the line numbers that the code blocks cover.\nExercise 7\nA lot of input strings give 100% line coverage.\nA very simple one is \"aa\".\nAs long as the string is longer than one character and makes the condition in line 9 true, it will give 100% line coverage.\nFor \"aa\" the expected output is \"a\".\nExercise 8\nAnswer 4. is correct.\nThe loop in the method makes it impossible to achieve 100% path coverage.\nThis would require us to test all possible number of iterations.\nFor the other answers we can come up with a test case: \"aXYa\"\nExercise 9\nFirst the condition coverage.\nWe have 8 conditions:\n\nLine 1: n % 3 == 0, true and false\nLine 1: n % 5 == 0, true and false\nLine 3: n % 3 == 0, true and false\nLine 5: n % 5 == 0, true and false\n\nT1 makes conditions 1 and 2 true and then does not cover the other conditions.\nT2 makes all the conditions false.\nIn total these test cases then cover 2+4=62 + 4 = 62+4=6 conditions so the condition coverage is 68⋅100%=75%\\frac{6}{8} \\cdot 100\\% = 75\\%​8​​6​​⋅100%=75%\nNow the decision coverage.\nWe have 6 decision:\n\nLine 1: n % 3 == 0 && n % 5 == 0, true and false\nLine 3: n % 3 == 0, true and false\nLine 5: n % 5 == 0, true and false\n\nNow T1 makes decision 1 true and does not cover the other decisions.\nT2 makes all the decision false.\nTherefore the coverage is 46⋅100%=66%\\frac{4}{6} \\cdot 100\\% = 66\\%​6​​4​​⋅100%=66%.\nExercise 10\n\nThe L\\ in the blocks represent the line number corresponding to the blocks.\nExercise 11\nAnswer: 3.\nOne test to cover lines 1 and 2.\nAnother test to cover lines 1, 3-7 and 8-13.\nFinally another test to cover lines 14 and 15. This test will also automatically cover lines 1, 3-10.\nExercise 12\nAnswer: 4.\nFrom the CFG we can see that there are 6 branches.\nWe need at least one test to cover the true branch from teh decision in line 1.\nThen with another test we can cover false from L1 and false from L8.\nWe add another test to cover false from the decision in line 10.\nFinally an additional test is needed to cover the true branch out of the decision in line 10.\nThis gives us a minimum of 4 tests.\nExercise 13\nMC/DC does subsume statement coverage. Basic condition coverage does not subsume branch coverage; full condition coverage does.\nExercise 14\nOption 1 is correct.\nExercise 15\nOption 1 is the correct one.\nTests for A = (2,6), B = (2,4), C = (3, 4), (5, 6), (7,8). Thus, from the options, tests 2, 3, 4 and 6 are the only ones that achieve 100% MC/DC. Note that 2, 4, 5, 6 could also be a solution.\nModel-Based Testing\nExercise 1\n\nYou should not need more than 4 states.\nExercise 2\n\nExercise 3\n\n  \n    \n    temperature reached\n    too hot\n    too cold\n    turn on\n    turn off\n  \n  \n    Idle\n    \n    Cooling\n    Heating\n    \n    Off\n  \n  \n    Cooling\n    Idle\n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    Heating\n    Idle\n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    Off\n    \n    \n    \n    Idle\n    \n  \n\n\nThere are 14 empty cells in the table, so there are 14 sneaky paths that we can test.\nExercise 4\n\nExercise 5\nWe have a total of 6 transitions.\nOf these transitions the four given in the test are covered and order cancelled and order resumed are not.\nThis coves a transition coverage of 46⋅100%=66.7%\\frac{4}{6} \\cdot 100\\% = 66.7\\%​6​​4​​⋅100%=66.7%\nExercise 6\n\n  \n    STATES\n    Events\n  \n  \n    \n    Order received\n    Order cancelled\n    Order resumed\n    Order fulfilled\n    Order delivered\n  \n  \n    Submitted\n    Processing\n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    Processing\n    \n    Cancelled\n    \n    Shipped\n    \n  \n  \n    Cancelled\n    \n    \n    Processing\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    Shipped\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Completed\n  \n  \n    Completed\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\nExercise 7\nAnswer: 20.\nThere are 20 empty cells in the decision table.\nAlso we have 5 states.\nThis means 5⋅5=255 \\cdot 5 = 255⋅5=25 possible transitions.\nThe state machine gives 5 explicit transitions so we have 25−5=2025 - 5 = 2025−5=20 sneak paths.\nExercise 8\nFirst we find pairs of decisions that are suitable for MC/DC: (We indicate a decision as a sequence of T and F. TTT would mean all conditions true and TFF means C1 true and C2, C3 false)\n\nC1: {TTT, FTT}, {FTF, TTF}, {FFF, TFF}, {FFT, TFT}\nC2: {TTT, TFT}, {TFF, TTF}\nC3: {TTT, TTF}, {FFF, FFT}, {FTF, FTT}, {TFF, TFT},\n\nAll condition can use the TTT decision, so we will use that.\nThen we can add FTT, TFT and TTF.\nNow we test each condition individually with it changing the outcome.\nIt might look line we are done, but MC/DC requires each action to be covered at least once.\nTo achieve this we add the FFF and TFF decision as test cases.\nIn this case we need to test each explicit decision in the decision table.\nExercise 9\n\nExercise 10\n\nExercise 11\n\nExercise 12\n\nExercise 13\nThere will be one extra super state (ACTIVE), which will be a superstate of the existing WARMING and DEFROSTING states. The edges from ON to WARMING and DEFROSTING will remain.\nThe two (cancel and time out) outgoing edges from WARMING and DEFROSTING (four edges in total) will be replaced by two edges going out of the super ACTIVE state.\nSo there will be two fewer transitions.\nExercise 14\n\n\n\n\nC1\nC2\nC3\nC4\nC5\nC6\nC7\nC8\n\n\n\n\nValid format?\nT\nT\nT\nT\nF\nF\nF\nF\n\n\nValid size?\nT\nT\nF\nF\nT\nT\nF\nF\n\n\nHigh resolution?\nT\nF\nT\nF\nT\nF\nT\nF\n\n\nOutcome\nsuccess\nsuccess\nfail\nfail\nfail\nfail\nfail\nfail\n\n\n\nExercise 15\n\n\n\n\nT1\nT2\nT3\n\n\n\n\nUser active in past two weeks\nT\nT\nT\n\n\nUser has seen ad in last two hours\nF\nF\nF\n\n\nUser has over 1000 followers\nT\nF\nF\n\n\nAd is highly relevant to user\nT\nT\nF\n\n\nServe ad?\nT\nT\nT\n\n\n\nDesign-by-contracts and property-based testing\nExercise 1\nboard != null\nFor a class invariant the assertions has to assert a class variable.\nboard is such a class variable, unlike the other variables that are checked by the assertions.\nThe other assertions are about the parameters (preconditions) or the result (postcondition).\nExercise 2\nThe existing preconditions are not enough to ensure the property in line 10.\nboard itself cannot be null and x and y will be in its range, but the content of board can still be null.\nTo guarantee the property again the method would have to implicitly assume an invariant, that ensures that no place in board is null.\nIn order to do this, we would have to make the constructor ensure that no place in board is null.\nSo we have to add an assertion to the constructor that asserts that every value in board is not null.\nExercise 3\nThe second colleague is correct.\nThere is a problem in the Square's preconditions.\nFor the resetSize method these are stronger than the Rectangle's preconditions.\nWe do not just assert that the width and height should be larger than 0, but they should also be equal.\nThis violates the Liskov's Substitution Principle.\nWe cannot substitute a Square for a Rectangle, because we would not be able to have unequal width and height anymore.\nExercise 4\nMaking correct use of a class should never trigger a class invariant violation.\nWe are making correct use of the class, as otherwise it would have been a precondition violation.\nThis means that there is a bug in the implementation of the library, which would have to be fixed.\nAs this is outside your project, you typically cannot fix this problem.\nExercise 5\nJust like the contracts we have a client and a server. \\\nA 4xx code means that the client invoked the server in a wrong way, which corresponds to failing to adhere to a precondition. \\\nA 5xx code means that the server was not able to handle the request of the client, which was correct.\nThis corresponds to failing to meet a postcondition.\nExercise 6\nP' should be equal or weaker than P, and Q' should be equal or stronger than Q.\nExercise 7\nTo make debugging easier.\nTesting pyramid\nExercise 1\n\nManual\nSystem\nIntegration\nUnit\nMore reality (interchangeable with 6)\nMore complexity (interchangeable ith 5)\n\nSee the diagram in the Testing Pyramid section.\nExercise 2\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\nThis is correct. The primary use of integration tests is to find mistakes in the communication between a system and its external dependencies\nUnit tests do not cover as much as integration tests. They cannot cover the communication between different components of the system.\nWhen using system tests the bugs will not be easy to identify and find, because it can be anywhere in the system if the test fails. Additionally, system tests want to execute the whole system as if it is run normally, so we cannot just mock the code in a system test.\nThe different test levels do not find the same kind of bugs, so settling down on one of the levels is not a good idea.\n\nExercise 3\nOption 4 is not required.\nChanging the transaction level is not really required. Better would be to actually exercise the transaction policy your application uses in production.\nExercise 4\nCorrect answer: Transitioning from a testing pyramid to an ice-cream cone anti-pattern\nExercise 5\nUnit testing.\nExercise 6\nThe interaction with the system is much closer to reality.\nExercise 7\nSystem tests tend to be slow and often are non-deterministic.\nSee https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html!\nMock Objects\nExercise 1\nThe correct answer is 4.\n\nThis line is required to create a mock for the OrderDao class.\nWith this line we check that the methods calls start with order on a delivery mock we defined. The method is supposed to start each order that is paid but not delivered.\nWith this line we define the behavior of the paidButNotDelivered method by telling the mock that it should return an earlier defined list.\nWe would never see this happen in a test that is testing the OrderDeliveryBatch class. By mocking the class we do not use any of its implementation. But the implementation is the exact thing we want to test. In general we never mock the class under test.\n\nExercise 2\nYou need mocks to both control and observe the behavior of the (external) conditions you mocked.\nExercise 3\nOption 1 is the false one. We can definitely get to 100% branch coverage there with the help of mocks.\nExercise 4\nOnly approach 2.\nDesign for Testability\nExercise 1\nTo test just the runBatch method of OrderDeliveryBatch (for example in a unit test) we need to be able to use mocks for at least the dao and delivery objects.\nIn the current implementation this is not possible, as we cannot change dao or delivery from outside.\nIn other words: We want to improve the controllability to improve the testability.\nThe technique that we use to do so is called dependency injection.\nWe can give the dao and delivery in a parameter of the method:\npublic class OrderDeliveryBatch {\n\n  public void runBatch(OrderDao dao, DeliveryStartProcess delivery) {\n    List orders = dao.paidButNotDelivered();\n\n    for (Order order : orders) {\n      delivery.start(order);\n\n      if (order.isInternational()) {\n        order.setDeliveryDate(\"5 days from now\");\n      } else {\n        order.setDeliveryDate(\"2 days from now\");\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nAlternatively we can create fields for the dao and delivery and a constructor that sets the fields:\npublic class OrderDeliveryBatch {\n\n  private OrderDao dao;\n  private DeliveryStartProcess delivery;\n\n  public OrderDeliveryBatch(OrderDao dao, DeliveryStartProcess delivery) {\n    this.dao = dao;\n    this.delivery = delivery;\n  }\n\n  public void runBatch() {\n    List orders = dao.paidButNotDelivered();\n\n    for (Order order : orders) {\n      delivery.start(order);\n\n      if (order.isInternational()) {\n        order.setDeliveryDate(\"5 days from now\");\n      } else {\n        order.setDeliveryDate(\"2 days from now\");\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nExercise 2\nThe method and class lack controllability.\nWe cannot change the values that Calender gives in the method because the getInstance method is static.\nMockito cannot really mock static methods, which is why we tend to avoid using static methods.\nWe can use depencency injection to make sure we can control the today object by using a mock.\nExercise 3\nThe correct answer is 1 and 3.\nAs we discussed it is very important to keep the domain and infrastructure separated for the testability.\nThis can be done, for example, by using Ports and Adapters.\nStatic methods cannot be mocked and are therefore very bad for the controllability of the code.\nCode that has low controllability also has a low testability, so replacing the static methods by non-static ones will be very beneficial to the testability.\nThe large tables and lack of indices do not really influence the testability, especially not when talking about unit tests.\nThere we end up mocking the classes interacting with the database anyway.\nToo many attributes/fields can hurt testability as we might need to create a lot of mocks for just one class under test.\nHowever, the static methods and mixed domain and infrastructure are worse for the testability than a large amount of attributes/fields.\nExercise 4\n\nObservability: The developer needs to be able to better observe the result.\nControllability: The developer has to be able to change (control) a certain variable or field.\nControllability: The developer should be able to control what instance of a class the class under test uses.\n\nTest-Driven Development\nExercise 1\n\nWrite failing test\nFailing test\nMake test pass\nPassing test\nRefactor\n\nFrom the explanation above:\n\nExercise 2\nHow did it feel to practice TDD?\nExercise 3\nOption 1 is the least important one.\nAlthough a few studies show that the number of tests written by TDD practitioners are often higher than the number of tests written by developers not practicing TDD, this is definitely not the main reason why developers have been using TDD. In fact, among the alternatives, it's the least important one. All other alternatives are more important reasons, according to the TDD literature (e.g., Kent Beck's book, Freeman's and Pryce's book.\nExercise 4\nOption 1 is not a benefit of TDD. The\nTDD literature says nothing about team integration.\nTest code quality\nExercise 1\nCorrect: Both tests are very slow.\nExercise 2\nCorrect answer: Mystery guest\nExercise 3\nCorrect answer: It is hard to tell which of several assertions within the same test method will cause a test failure.\nExercise 4\nFlaky test.\nExercise 5\nTo avoid the flakiness, a developer could have mocked the random function. It does not make sense, the test is about testing the generator and its homogeinity; if we mock, the test looses its purposes.\nMutation testing\nExercise 1\nMutation testing.\n"},"chapters/appendix/changelog.html":{"url":"chapters/appendix/changelog.html","title":"Change log","keywords":"","body":"Changelog\n(Once we release a first final version, we'll write our changes here.)\n"}}}
